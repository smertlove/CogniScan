        "abstract": "Platelets are an easily accessible model for the study of biochemical mechanisms of mental diseases, including schizophrenia and depression. This literature review addresses a role of platelet activation in the pathogenesis of mental diseases. Platelet activation observed in patients with schizophrenia, depression and other mental illnesses is associated with the development of cardiovascular disease and an increased risk of thrombotic complications, which can be the main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with mental disorders. A deeper understanding of the biochemical mechanisms of mental disorders will help in the study of clinical consequences of these disorders and in choosing the right therapeutic strategy for patients."

        "abstract": "To analyze mental disorders in blepharospasm (BS) before and after botulinum therapy (BT). We examined 25 patients with BS (9 men and 16 women), aged 50 to 85 years (mean 64.1±18.5), with BS (main study group). The control group consisted of 20 healthy individuals (7 men and 13 women, mean age 63.5±8.5). Patients were examined before and after BT (after 3 weeks) using a diagnostic structured interview Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, GAD-7, PHQ-9, fear of negative assessment (short version) and The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). Fifty-six percent of patients with BS, as assessed by the GAD-7, showed a high level of anxiety, while depression, measured by the PHQ-9 and found in 52% of patients, was mainly manifested by mild disorders. In the group of patients with BS, the mean scores were higher on the GAD-7, PHQ-9, fear of negative assessment (<i>p</i><0.001) and LSAS (<i>p</i><0.05) than in the control group. After treatment with BT, the levels of anxiety and depression in patients with BS decreased slightly and remained higher compared with the control group. Psychiatric examination in the majority (64%) of patients revealed mental disorders that could not be explained by the occurrence of BS. The remaining 36% of patients had adaptation disorders (nosogenic reactions) caused by BS. Affective mental pathology (recurrent depressive disorder and dysthymia) and anxiety disorders (social phobia and adjustment disorders) were more often observed in the main study group compared with the control group (24% versus 5% and 68% versus 10%, respectively). A significant proportion of patients with BS have anxiety and depressive disorders, the severity of which does not depend only on the severity of motor symptoms and does not significantly decrease after successful BT, but is caused by mental disorders that preceded the manifestation of BS. Identification of mental disorders to varying degrees associated with BS, not only on the basis of psychometric scales, but also consultation with a psychiatrist, will allow, in addition to the correction of motor symptoms of BS, to differentiate the therapeutic approach through psychotherapy and psychopharmacotherapy."

        "abstract": "The review addresses an urgent problem of suicide in adolescents. The prevalence of suicidal behavior in adolescents worldwide and In Russia is analyzed, and its main causes are identified. It is believed that the basis for suicidal activity is primarily psychopathological disorders, both as part of established psychiatric diseases and at the prodromal stage of mental disorders, when the first transient and nonspecific symptoms appear. When triggered by external causes, such a pathological basis easily leads to the adolescent's suicidal readiness, which explains the common discrepancy between the insignificance of provoking factors and the severity of the consequences of suicidal activity. It determines the need for early recognition of the first symptoms of future mental illness and the establishment of their role in the development of suicidal behavior in adolescents."

A systematic review of the literature in PubMed, Elsevier, Google, using keywords over the past 10 years was conducted. It is shown that data on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the elderly population, including in comparison with young adults, diverge significantly. The significant incidence of mental disorders among nursing home residents is highlighted. The relevance of non-psychotic disorders of the depressive and anxiety spectrum in older adults is demonstrated. The difficulty of diagnosing mental disorders associated with somatic pathology as well as cognitive disorders in elderly patients is demonstrated. Risk factors for mental disorders in older adults are socio-demographic as well as economic, psychological and somatic factors. The problem of mental health of the elderly under the COVID-19 pandemic associated with specific risk factors for mental disorders is characterized. The shortage of evidence-based research in the treatment of mental disorders in old age and the urgency to improve the organization of psychiatric care for such patients are noted. Understanding the structure and prevalence of mental disorders among the elderly will allow to optimize the work of the healthcare system."

In the article, the prospects for the use of the multimodal antidepressant trazodone are discussed in accordance with therapeutic targets. The latter are discussed in accordance with the typology of the mentioned above psychosomatic disorders. Trazodone is an antidepressant acting primarily due to the blockade of postsynaptic serotonin 5H2A- and 5H2C-receptors, as well as the blockade of serotonin reuptake, but also has affinity for a number of additional receptors. The drug has a favorable safety profile and a wide range of beneficial effects: antidepressive, somnolent, anxiolytic, anti-dysphoric and somatotropic. This makes it possible to influence a wide range of therapeutic targets in the structure of mental disorders caused or triggered by somatic and neurological diseases, carrying out safe and effective psychopharmacotherapy."

Clinical-anamnestic, clinical-psychopathological, clinical-statistical methods were used. The duration of the initial stage of the disease ranged from several hours to 5 years (median 0.8 [0.5; 1.7]. The structure of initial disorders was dominated by nonspecific mental disorders characterized by a combination of symptoms of non-psychotic and subpsychotic levels (20 patients - 43.5%; including 12 males - 26% and 8 females - 24.1% ). If behavioral disorders and episodes of psychoactive substance use were significantly more often detected in boys, then dysmorphic phenomena were detected in girls (<i>p</i><0.05).

A psychotic episode in adolescents suffering from schizophrenia developed acutely in a third of cases. In the vast majority of cases, the initial mental disorders that appeared on the eve of acute psychosis was subacute, or differed in a fluctuating course, characterized by clinical polymorphism and multidirectionality.

We studied 67 inpatients, aged 50 to 95 years, with various mental illnesses in accordance with the ICD-10 criteria, who underwent COVID-19 from February 2020 to December 2021. Forty-six people were previously mentally ill, in 21 cases the disease developed for the first time. The group of primary diseased patients was dominated by depressive episodes (F32, (42.9%), including psychotic episodes (9.5%). In 28.6% of cases, organic disorders were diagnosed in the form of emotional lability (F06.6), organic depression (F06.3), mild cognitive impairment (F06.7) and delirium (F05.86). In 23.8% of patients, neurotic disorders were observed in the form of depressive reactions (F43), panic (F41.0) and generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1). In one case (4.8%), acute polymorphic psychosis with symptoms of schizophrenia (F23.1) was diagnosed. The diagnoses of the previously mentally ill group were: affective disorders (F31, F32, F33 - 45.7%); organic disorders, including dementia (F06.3, F06.7, F00.1, F00.2 - 26.1%); schizophrenia spectrum disorders (F25, F21, F22, F20.01 - 19.6%), and neurotic somatoform disorders (F45 - 8.7%). In the acute and subacute periods of COVID-19 (≤3 months), acute psychotic states (APS) developed in both groups of patients (in 23.3% and 30.4%, respectively) in the form of delirium, psychotic depression, or polymorphic psychosis. APS were more common in mentally ill patients with organic (50%) and schizophrenia spectrum (33.3%) disorders with a predominance of delirium. In the long-term period of COVID-19, mentally ill patients more often than primary diseased patients (60.9% and 38.1%) developed cognitive impairment (CI), especially in schizophrenic (77.8%) and organic (83.3%) disorders. CI developed twice as often after APS (89.5% and 39.6%, <i>p</i><0.001), reaching the degree of dementia in 15.8% of cases. APS were significantly associated (<i>p</i><0.05) with the development of CI (0.567733), the age of patients (0.410696) and the presence of previous cerebrovascular insufficiency (0.404916). The age-related features of the mental consequences of COVID-19 are the occurrence of APS in the acute period of infection and the deterioration of cognitive activity at a remote stage. The mentally ill, especially those of the organic and schizophrenia spectrum, were found to be more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19. In them, the occurrence of APS was a risk factor for the development of dementia, while in primary diseased, affective and neurotic patients, CI was reversible or had the character of a mild cognitive disorder."

These included the overall and primary incidence of mental and behavioral disorders (MBD), as well as substance use-related MBD (MBDSUR), as calculated per 100.000 people for the period 2015 to 2022. The period 2015 to 2019 was the reference period and 2020 to 2022 was the pandemic period. The calculation was carried out by age groups: children (0-14 years), adolescents (15-17 years), adults (over 18 years), adults over working age (from 55 years for women and from 60 years for men). Statistical processing of the results included regression analysis, calculation of incidence forecast for 2023-2025, and assessment of the significance of the changes using the t-criterion. The decrease in the overall incidence of MBD in adults was highly deterministic (R2=0.82; <i>p</i>=0.012) and significant between 2017-2018 (<i>p</i>=0.009), 2018-2019 (<i>p</i>=0.001) and 2019-2020 (<i>p</i>=0.004). High determination with a logarithmic trend line was characteristic of almost all models, except for the primary incidence of MBD in children and overall incidence of MBDSUR in adults over working age, including after 2020. Among adolescents, the overall incidence of MBDSUR decreased significantly from 2015 to 2022 (<i>p</i>=0.042). There was no significant increase in the incidence of MBD, including MBDURS, during the pandemic. At the same time, there was a trend towards the decrease in adults, as well as the increase in the primary incidence of MBD in children and the overall incidence of MBDSUR in adults over working age, which determines the need for further identification of risk factors and development of specific rehabilitation measures for patients in these groups."

Age-specific population data were taken from the Russian database on fertility and mortality. The methods of econometric and statistical analysis (the index method, the Irwin method, the Chow test) were used. In the Arkhangelsk Oblast, as well as in the whole country, there has been a growth in disability rates over the last decade. The level of the general children's disability in AO was lower than in the RF on the average by 25.7 (±3.45)%. The age groups 5-9 (6.03%) and 15-17 (3.70%) years contribute mostly to the ten-year trend in the overall rate of mental disabilities. The increase in childhood disability due to mental disorders was 13.96% over 2010-2019, with this increase being due to so-called 'other mental disorders' (all mental disorders other than mental retardation) by 27.29%, while the dynamic contribution of disability due to mental retardation (F70-F79) was negative (-13.32%). The dynamics of total disability in children due to mental disorders in the AO has a common with the Russian average upward trend at a lower level. The age groups 5-9 and 15-17 years old have the greatest significance for the dynamic changes in the general disability of children due to mental disorders. The leading nosological group responsible for the ten-year increase in disability due to mental disorders is «other mental disorders»."

        "abstract": "Studies of the genomic architecture of complex phenotypes, which include common somatic and mental diseases, have shown that they are characterized by a high degree of polygenicity, i.e. participation of a large number of genes associated with the risk of developing these diseases. In this regard, it is of interest to establish the genetic overlapping between these two groups of diseases. The aim of the review is to analyze genetic studies of the comorbidity of somatic and mental diseases in terms of the universality and specificity of mental disorders in somatic diseases, the reciprocal relationships of these types of pathologies, and the modulating influence of environmental factors on comorbidity. The results of the analysis indicate the existence of a common genetic predisposition to mental and somatic diseases. At the same time, the presence of common genes does not exclude the specificity of the development of mental disorders depending on a specific somatic pathology. It can be assumed that there are genes that are both unique to a particular somatic and comorbid mental illness, and genes that are common to these diseases. Common genes may have varying degrees of specificity, that is, they may be of a universal nature, which, for example, manifests itself in the development of MDD in various somatic diseases, or be specific only for a couple of individual diseases (schizophrenia - breast cancer). At the same time, common genes can have a multidirectional effect, which also contributes to the specificity of comorbidity. In addition, when searching for common genes for somatic and mental diseases, it is necessary to take into account the modulating influence of such confounders as treatment, unhealthy life style, behavioral characteristics, which can also differ in specificity depending on the diseases under consideration."

They affect millions of people around the world and have a significant impact on the quality of life and people's ability to function in a normal environment. In this regard, the issues of ensuring the rights of citizens suffering from mental disorders do not lose their relevance and require special attention from doctors, lawyers and the scientific community. There are a number of reasons for this, including: 1) an increase in the incidence of mental disorders among the population, especially among socially vulnerable groups such as refugees, orphans, victims of hostilities and natural disasters; 2) medical care for mentally ill people can be provided forcibly, and therefore requires firmly established procedural standards; 3) mentally ill people often pose a danger to both for themselves and for society, therefore, the existence of fair law-restrictive measures is necessary; 4) persons with the status of mentally ill should have guarantees of social protection and integration into society without violating personal freedom (in the case when patients are not socially dangerous).

The authors consider the current state of research in the field of non-PMD of old age, including neurotic disorders (ND). An analysis of the literature has shown that there is no convergent view on the ND of old age. As a consequence, there are contradictory views from researchers or psychiatric schools on the ND prevalence and morbidity. Attention is drawn to the insufficient diagnosis of non-PMD in the primary link of health care, difficulties of distinguishing ND from neurotic-like states, necessity in the clarification of the epidemiology of neuroses and efficiency of psychotherapeutic help. The use of resources of able-bodied people is important for the socio-economic development of the country."

        "abstract": "The dynamics of the concept of the continual development of mental disease from the constitution that was the most clearly formulated by a Russian psychiatrist Th. Tiling in the discussion with the German psychiatrist C. Neisser is presented. The concept of Th. Tiling influenced E. Bleuler's approach to the description of basic and accessory symptoms of schizophrenia and also on E. Kretschmer's concept of constitution and mental disease. Main characteristics of cycloid and schizoid personality of E. Kretschmer's concept are presented. The author notes the very broad E. Kretschmer's understanding of 'psychesthetic proportion', which state explains not only the diversity of schizoid types but also many psychotic psychopathological phenomena. In addition to the altered affectivity, autism was the second basic symptom of schizophrenia, which mild manifestations form the basis for E. Kretschmer systematics of schizoid types. E. Kretschmer's understanding of autism was broader than Bleuler's and was presented by E. Kretschmer as a symptom derived from special schizoid affectivity (psychesthetic proportion). The critics of E. Kretschmer's concept by some contemporary German psychiatrists is also considered."

Some medications can also cause insomnia. Timely treatment of insomnia can lead to a favorable outcome (recovery) not only by alleviating the symptoms of a concomitant mental disorder, but also by preventing new episodes. Therefore, it is crucial to be aware of the association between insomnia and mental illness. This review addresses this association and provides guidelines for diagnosis and therapy."

Centro-temporal spikes prevailing in the left hemisphere were observed in older children and predominantly related to verbal and speech disorders. Occipital spikes were observed in younger children mainly in the right hemisphere being related to non-verbal and neuropsychological disorders. In both groups, a wide spectrum of behavioral and mental disorders including speech as well as visual and functional disorders, attention deficit and hyperactivity, global mental delay, difficulties in study was observed, the disorders being combined in some cases. Clinical symptoms in both types of spikes are thought to be related to their localization in the brain cortex, functional hemisphere asymmetry and peculiarities of the child neurodevelopment. The pathological types presented in the study should be named \"idiopathic focal epileptiform spikes in children\". In all cases, both children with respective forms of epilepsy and those with epileptiform phenomena being not combined with epileptic seizures should undergo encephalographic, neuropsychological and pediatric examination. Should the respective disturbances be found, children would need a treatment directed to the EEG-controlled inhibition of epileptiform activity. The data obtained suggest that this treatment improves children school adaptation and school results.

Another area of Bekhterev research is the concept of a holistic assessment of a person. In this regard, V.M.

The 1st group included 49 (59%) patients, the 2nd - 34 (41%) patients who had symptoms of POPR at 39.2±2.8 and 46.5±2.2 years, respectively, and alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) formed at 53.8±1.2 years and 66.8±0.9 years, accordingly. The study used questionnaires - social interviews, clinical (anamnesis collection), catamnestic, dynamic observation, statistical (parametric and nonparametric) methods. Patients of group 1 began systematic alcohol intake at a younger age (cf. age 46.2±1.2 years), a low-grade course prevailed (53.1%), AWS appeared at an average age of 57.2±1.8 years, was of pronounced severity (21.32±2.48 points), the psychopathological variant dominated.

The special interest was guided by the fact that many types of psychopathic personalities were described by E. Kraepelin in other rubrics: «primary morbid states», manic-depressive illness, paranoia, hysteria, Dementia praecox. E. Kraepelin gave also a prognosis of further development of psychopathic personality and by this way analyzed its dynamics. So, for example, he found that the prognosis of unstable personalities is less favorable compared to those with excitable type. E. Kraepelin subdivided the types of «liars and swindlers», \"antisocial\" and also hysterics according to the prognosis in stationary and regredient courses. The regredient course of psychopathy E. Kraepelin explained by behindhand maturing of psychopathic traits caused by partial infantilism. Constitutionally depressed, constitutionally excited, irritable and cyclothymic psychopathic types distinguished by their disposition to phasic manifesting affective disorders (MDP), but were capable also to remain stationary during the lifetime as the corresponding three types of psychopathic personalities delineated by E. Kraepelin in schizophrenia. The type of «nervous» (from the rubric of «primary morbid states») was the ground for obsessive-compulsive neurosis, sexual perversions and also was able to combine with more or less prominent traits of other psychopathic types. According to clinical features, the «nervous» type was the expression of the conceptually preceding notion of general «degenerative constitution». It is important to note that E. Kraepelin considered the possibilities of combinations of different psychopathic types (connections of psychopathic traits) but never considered the possibility of development from one innate psychopathic type in the other."

This is a report from the Task Force on Education of the ILAE Commission on Neuropsychiatry based on a survey about educational needs of epileptologists regarding management of the psychiatric comorbidities of epilepsy. The Task Force designed a quantitative questionnaire to survey the self-perceived confidence of child and adult epileptologists and psychiatrists in managing major psychiatric comorbidities of epilepsy to identify: (1) critical areas of improvement from a list of skills that are usually considered necessary for effective management of these conditions, and (2) the preferred educational format for improving these skills. A total of 211 respondents from 36 different countries participated in the survey. Confidence and usefulness scores suggest that responders would most value education and training in the management of specific clinical scenarios. Child neurologists identified major Axis I disorders, such as mood and anxiety disorders, while adult neurologists identified attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, intellectual disabilities, and autistic spectrum disorder as key areas. Both adult and child neurologists identified screening skills as the priority. Psychiatrists mainly valued specific training in the management of psychiatric complications of epilepsy surgery or psychiatric adverse events of antiepileptic drugs. Sessions during congresses and face-to-face meetings represent the preferred educational format, while e-learning modules and review papers were chosen by a minority of respondents. Results of this survey identify key areas for improvement in managing the psychiatric comorbidities of epilepsy and suggest specific strategies to develop better training for clinicians involved in epilepsy care."

Modern classifications of diseases, aimed at expanding our ideas about the distinction between the norm and pathology of mental disorders, do not contribute to a clear psychopathological differentiation of SPP, the determination of its nosological affiliation and the choice of appropriate therapeutic tactics for these conditions. To date, there is no unity of ideas about SPP among psychiatrists, and the conflict between different interpretations of the phenomenon persists. The aim of this review was to analyze scientific studies devoted to the SPP within the framework of psychiatric pathology in mature age patients, in order to differentiate the underlying psychopathological disorders, to determine the nosological affiliation and the specific therapeutic approaches of these conditions.

The dynamics of psychiatric views on the SPP within the framework of mental disorders over time was assessed. The study of the SPP remains a challenging multidisciplinary problem for contemporary scientific research.

Psychosocial factors included measures of child close and distant environment. Prevalence of psychiatric disorder in Siberian children is around 15-20%; emotional and behavioural disorders are the two most common categories. Psychosocial factors explained around 15% of internalising problems, and up to 30% of externalising problems. Harsh parenting was a risk factor; intact family, parent's education, family cohesion and safe neighbourhood contributed to the lower level of problems. The rate of child psychiatric problems in Siberia is higher than in the developed countries; the type of the problems is similar to other countries. Life style factors were more powerful predictors than measures of socio-economic status. Prevention should be aimed at identified risk factors and disadvantaged children."

It is concluded that the clinically significant discrepancy between the audiological symptoms and the results obtained by the objective methods for hearing evaluation should be interpreted with great caution and raise the suspicion of the disease. The diagnosis and the identification of the involved psychogenic factors are of utmost importance for the success of the treatment."

The study included 97 CTH patients, randomized into two groups. Patients in Group 1 (main) (<i>n=</i>45) received a personalized approach, including psychiatrist consulting and psychopharmacotherapy, according to their comorbid psychopathological symptoms. The comparison group patients (<i>n=</i>52) received standard care with neurologist consultation and follow-up. The study protocol involved 6 months of therapy and follow-up with efficacy assessment at two points - 3 and 6 months after the start of treatment. The pain severity was assessed using VAS and McGill questionnaire. The severity of subjective pain, the patient's focus on his disease, and the pain catastrophizing were assessed using the pain catastrophization scale (PCS). Insomnia symptoms were objectively assessed using the insomnia severity index (ISI) questionnaire. The Hamilton scale was used to assess the severity of depression. A personalized approach involving a psychiatrist in the management of patients with CTH and concomitant mental disorders is significantly more effective in the short term and retains certain advantages over the standard of care six months after the start of treatment. The results of the study indicate the need for a wider use of a personalized approach in the clinical practice for CTH patients."

Clinical and psychometric methods were used. The level of social functioning was measured with the Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP). At baseline, 23.8% (<i>n=</i>167) of patients met the criteria of the code F23 and 6.8% (<i>n</i>=35) of the code F25. Two years later the diagnoses were distributed as follows: F25 - 39.96% (<i>n</i>=205) and F21 - 17.4% (<i>n</i>=180). Affective disorders predominated in female patients (women - 23.6%; <i>n</i>=72; men - 18.7%, <i>n</i>=39), schizophrenia spectrum disorders were more frequent in men (81.3%; <i>n</i>=167) compared with women (75.5%, <i>n</i>=156). At the time of admission to the hospital, the number of non-working and non-student patients prevailed (52.4%, <i>n</i>=268). Most of them were female patients (31.5%, <i>n</i>=161). According to PSP, the majority of patients had moderate impairment of social functioning (82.0%) at the start of the study. After 2 years of follow-up, the majority of patients showed mild impairment of social functioning (92.0%). The results obtained indicate a rather favorable variant of the course of endogenous mental disorders over the period studied, which may be due to the volume of complex specialized care provided."

It is shown that before the appearance of distinct symptoms of parkinsonism and the genetic study that confirmed the diagnosis, the patient had been observed for several years with various psychiatric diagnoses and received psychotropic therapy. This case demonstrates the difficulties of differential diagnosis of juvenile parkinsonism in children at the initial stage due to multiple comorbid motor, affective and behavioral disorders. When neurological symptoms appear in patients, a multidisciplinary approach is required, including joint diagnostics by psychiatrists and neurologists to establish an accurate diagnosis and select the optimal therapy. The introduction of principles of interdisciplinary interaction in the management of such patients will improve the timeliness of diagnosis and pathogenetically based therapy."

        "abstract": "In the last century, fundamental and applied psychology has established a view of mental health as a qualitatively distinct condition, determined not only by the absence of symptoms of psychopathology but also by several positive characteristics. These include subjective well-being, positive emotions, psychological resilience, emotional competence, and a person's social maturity appropriate for the age and cultural expectations. However, modern epidemiological and experimental studies operate mainly with a negative definition of mental health, compiling control groups of so-called «neurotypical volunteers» based on the absence of a history of mental disorders in them and sometimes also in their blood relatives. There are no explicit criteria for mental health or patient recovery in clinical protocols for diagnosing mental disorders. The gap between the theoretical and operational definitions of mental health is due to the insufficient popularity of tools for assessing the parameters of mental activity necessary for a person to function optimally in everyday life. The purpose of the review is to analyze recent empirical studies on the neurocognitive mechanisms for maintaining and restoring mental health. The paper justifies the need to develop practice methods for diagnosing a person's mental health within a modern humanistic approach."

The thrombodynamics test (TD) was carried out on a T-2 thrombodynamics device according to the manufacturer's instructions (Hemacore LLC, Moscow, Russia). In patients with endogenous mental disorders after combined therapy with antidepressants and antipsychotics, a statistically significant decrease in the procoagulant activity of plasma and procoagulant spontaneous clots is observed, which indicates a decrease in the severity of systemic, immune inflammation. In patients with endogenous mental disorders after antipsychotic therapy without the addition of antidepressants, for most thrombodynamic parameters, there is no statistically significant decrease in procoagulant plasma activity and spontaneous clots formation. It indicates the persistence of acute systemic, immune inflammation in this group. The statistically significant positive change in plasma and platelet hemostasis may testify that combined treatment with antipsychotics and antidepressants in patients with endogenous mental disorders may be a biological, pathogenetic link that promotes augmentation (extended action) of antipsychotic therapy."

Changes in State alcohol sale and alcohol consumption and certain forms of alcohol-related harm were observed as a function of time. Following the 1985 anti-alcohol campaign, State alcohol sales decreased by 38.0% in 1.5 years in Moscow, and total consumption decreased by 28.6%. At the same time, admissions for alcohol-related mental and behavioural disorders, deaths from liver cirrhosis, alcohol poisoning and other blood alcohol positive violent deaths decreased by 63.3%, 33.0%, 50.8% and 50.9%, respectively. There was a linear correlation between medical variables and alcohol consumption during its decrease in 1985-86. An increase in blood alcohol positive violent deaths began in 1987, before the increases in other variables. Growth of total alcohol consumption began in 1987, and continued during all subsequent years, although it was especially high in 1992-93 at the time of the introduction of market reforms in Russia. Alcohol-related mental and behavioural disorders and liver cirrhosis mortality increased after a time-lag following the rise in alcohol consumption. The findings provide stark evidence of the potential impact of policy measures applied to general alcohol consumption on alcohol-related harm."

The first symptoms appeared only after the death of most specific regulatory neurons and exhaustion of brain compensatory reserve. Only at that time, one can make the diagnosis and start traditional treatment of patients that accounts for the extremely low efficacy of the latter.

Manifestation of a nozogeny reaction is closely correlated with premorbid personality characteristics. Anxious - depressive nozogenic reaction (n=17) is strongly correlated with the anxious type of personality accentuation and weakly correlated with personality characteristics of the affective (bipolar) range. Anxious-nozogenic dissociative response (n=9) was characteristic of hysterical and expansive schizotypal PD with a significant direct correlation with constitutional hyperthymia. Anxiety - hypomanic nozogeny response (n=4) was observed in schizotypal PD correlated with symptoms of persistent hyperthymia.

An analysis of publications of 9 Russian psychiatric journals for the period 2011-2015 and program reports of the XV and XVI Russian psychiatric congresses shows that very small attention is given to this pathology. According to the author's opinion, many aspects of this problem are unexplored or controversial. Some different interpretations of the term 'exogenous organic' makes it uninformative. There are not clear ideas about the structure of the clinical exogenous-organic disorders; their prevalence in different populations is not well studied; their combination with other mental illnesses requires further studies. One of the causes of it is a lack of attention of specialists to this pathology because it has not been included in the ICD-10. The solution of this problem is the creation of a national classification of mental disorders, which would include exogenous-organic mental disorders and, at the same time, would be integrated with the new version of ICD."

A single-center cohort prospective study was conducted at the Central Military Clinical Hospital, A.A. Vishnevsky (Krasnogorsk, Russia). The study examined 27 service members hospitalized in different somatic departments from October 2022 to June 2023. The mean age of the examined subjects was 36.0 years (28.25; 45.0). The duration of commitment was 5.73 months (2.83; 10.74). The duration of the period since the injury was 2.07 months (0.47; 5.88). The clinical-psychopathological, psychometric, and statistical methods of the study were used. The data obtained showed two groups of combatants, differing in the types of emotional-behavioral stress response and mental state. The first group is «military timogenies» as part of the F43 diagnosis «Reaction to severe stress and adjustment disorders» (<i>n</i>=22). In the psychopathological structure of this group, the leading role was played by anxiety disorders with a distinct hypothymic component with episodes of obsessive, realistic memories of hostilities, incomplete postconcussive syndrome, and conversion disorders. The second group included patients with reactive paranoid symptoms that developed in the prehospital or in-hospital stages (<i>n</i>=5), qualified under F23, «Acute and transient psychotic disorders.» A distinctive feature of the patients of this group was the prevailing premorbid paranoia accentuation, which was further reflected in the clinical presentation of psychosis closely related to the conditions of combat stress. The obtained results make it possible to draw preliminary conclusions about the absence of differences in the clinical forms of reactive psychotic disorders and adjustment disorders in the context of modern warfare in comparison with the wars of the 20th century."

The main disorder obligate to all psychopathic personalities is mental infantilism whereas the inadequacy of emotional manifestations and alterations in the sphere of thinking are considered as secondary manifestations determining one or another clinical variant of psychopathy and are related to congenital mental activity of a given individual."

The patients had mainly disseminated pulmonary tuberculosis with copious bacilli excretion and destruction. Their clinical manifestations and the course of a specific process were mainly progressive. Fatal outcomes were most common in tuberculosis patients with concurrent drug addiction and toxicomania. It is recommended that patients with mental diseases, narcomania and toxicomania should undergo a prophylactic fluorographic screening twice a year. Treatment of patients with tuberculosis and concurrent mental diseases should be combined and carried out by a psychiatrist (narcologist) jointly with a phthisiatrist."

These diseases present quite novel pathogenic factors, adaptation to which in the course of evolution is lacking. Development of civilization constantly stimulates the emergence of numerous qualitatively new pathogenic factors, on the one hand, and changes the conditions for impact of conventional factors, on the other hand. This process is becoming more and more intensive and makes the sequence \"cause-specific pathogenesis-clinical symptoms-nosological unity-relevant etiotropic and pathogenetic treatment\" less obvious. From this follow difficulties in application of routine methods of diagnosis, etiotropic and pathogenetic therapy based on the nosological principle as well as interest to methods of \"alternative' (complementary) medicine which are nonspecific and, therefore, in some cases effective against some \"diseases of civilization\"."

        "abstract": "The paper is concerned with the questions of genesis of psychopathological symptomatics in terms of the theory of Academician G. N. Kryzhanovsky of determinant structures and generator activity. The complexity of experimental modelling of severe psychopathological disorders is indicated since not all psychopathological phenomena possess objective characteristics. It should be keep in mind that the psychopathological method itself is a subjective one. The stability of clinical manifestations of psychoses, e.g. schizophrenia, and reactions to the psychopharmacotherapy in an individual over a long period of time suggests the involvement in pathological process of determinant structures. Variety of clinical manifestations of schizophrenia is predetermined by unequal involvement of the brain hemispheres. In connection with this one may think about the determinant structures and generator mechanisms predominating in either hemisphere. Quantitative EEG investigation in schizophrenia patients with hallucinatory-paranoid and schizoaffective symptomatics showed that in the former group after a week long therapy using stelazine the activation of the left hemisphere prevailed, and in the latter group--of the right one. Stelazine predominantly blocks the hemisphere in which generator processes are weaker (the right one in the case of hallucinatory-paranoid syndrome, and the left hemisphere with the schizoaffective one). This accounts for a great probability of development of postpsychotic depression in the patients with the schizoaffective syndrome after administration of neuroleptic therapy. Phenomenologically similar psychopathological symptomatics, in particular a depressive one, can occur as a result of the activities of various determinant structures. Anxiety, unlike other psychopathological phenomena, is responsive to practically all types of psychotropic compounds with different mechanisms of action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

A complex of specially created projective methods for assessment of danger perception and psychometric methods for personality assessment scales were used. Adolescents with mental disorders tend to increase the subjective danger level. In qualitative aspect, bizarre judgments about danger which reflect disease patterns, divergence between danger estimation and its interpretation, impulsivity of estimation and poor use of previous experience have been detected. Healthy adolescents perceive danger as a source of positive emotions, new experience and a reason for communication. Common traits in danger perception, including the distribution of results of danger situation selection and interpretations of uncertain hazards, in adolescents with mental disorders and their healthy peers were found.

Neurotic disorders have been reported in all the patients: 53.8% having neurasthenic syndrome, 30% anxiety- or astheno-subdepressive syndrome, 16.2% neurotic hypochondriac symptomatology. After treatment with minor neuroleptics, antidepressants and tranquilizers, patients' psychic state improved, even when the objective urologic data remained unchanged. Treatment of mental disorders makes it possible to prepare a patient for the operation and to improve quality of life of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia before the operation."

        "abstract": "Borderline mental disorders and affective disturbances of the actual mental status of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) were studied; they were corrected with cognitive psychotherapy. The subjects of the study were 107 patients with a validated CAD diagnosis (FK I to III stenocardia) and chronic heart failure (CHF) syndrome, and 78 patients suffering from CAD without CHF. Mental disorders were diagnosed in accordance to International Classification of Diseases-10. Borderline mental disorders in CAD patients chiefly consisted in adaptation disorders (46.8%), dysthymia (16%), neurotic disorders (13.8%), and organic mental disorders (23.4%). The listed disorders in most cases occur as a result of stress, which, according to the study, is caused mainly by cardiac pathology; although these disorders are superficial and polymorphic, they play a significant role in the psychosomatic mechanism of the occurrence and deterioration of CAD. The occurrence of heart failure facilitates the growth of depressive affect in CAD patients (75.7% of CHF patients vs. 42.3% of patients without CHF), which is usually accompanied by anxiety disorder. Correction of psychological orientation and reduction of involvement in the problem, as well as disease education during a 3-week course led to more than a two-fold reduction in the level of depression and anxiety."

The poly-effect method of registering the physiological functions (ECG, EEG, GSR) was recognized as a potent tool for gathering information to be used in actual state assessment. Starting from the 96-d flight of Yu. Romanenko and G.

The study group was divided by age into children from infantile age to 15 years and 16-28-year-olds. The wide range of psychopathologic disorders were revealed in children up to 15 years of age: syndrome of hyperactivity, neurotic disturbances, mental retardation, epileptic-like syndrome. Alcoholism was found in sons only (3.77%). Mental disorders were revealed significantly more frequently in sons of alcoholic fathers than in their daughters. Their incidence increased with the age of the sons. The disturbances occurred significantly more frequently in the test group as compared with the control one (19 and 6.38%, respective by). In the older group (16-28-year-olds) the spectrum of mental disorders consisted of alcoholism, mental retardation, psychopathic-like and neurotic disorders. Alcoholism occurred most frequent and its rate depended on the age and sex. Frequency of alcoholism was 66.7% in sons aged 21-28 years and 15.38% in daughters of the same age. The conclusion was made about multiple risk for children of alcoholic fathers. More vulnerable contingent was the sons for which the risk of alcoholism was very high."

In the group of OMD the main form of disturbances were cases with dementia (74.4%) mainly of the Alzheimer's type, and cerebral vascular dementia. In 25.3% of the patients the cognitive disturbances didn't attain the level of dementia. In a group of patients with different forms of dementia a high frequency of comorbid mental pathology was observed (83%)--confusional states, delusions, depressive conditions as well as disturbed behavior (67.7%) that was one of the reasons for consulting a psychiatrist. In FMD group the prevailing pathology were depressions, both of the major (37.1%) and mild (34.6%) forms. The remaining cases were characterized by delusions (10.1%), anxiety-phobic (7.6%) states and somatoform disturbances (5.1%). Among the patients both of OMD and FMD groups it was possible to diagnose approximately 3-4 different somatic diseases; vascular and gastrointestinal disorders were met more frequently. The study of contribution of brain computer tomography (CT) to diagnosis of mental pathology (according to ICD-10), has demonstrated that in 30.8% of the cases it was decisive, in 41% it confirmed the clinical data and in 21.8% CT provide additional data (detecting latent cerebral vascular damage).

In cases of intrafamily abuse, uncontrolled drives, sexual character of games and fantasies, elements of depersonalization and age-specific transformation of affective disorders from depressiveness to dysphoric aggressive reactions were observed.

Analysis of the 3-year statistical data for the whole country made it possible to ascertain that the years 1988-1989 may be classified as crucial in terms of the changes in conventional approaches to the formation of the patients' groups followed up by the dispensary and as pioneering from the standpoint of distinguishing the patients' groups to be given medical advice. On the whole in 1989, the total number of mental patients treated by the outpatient psychoneurological institutions of this country underwent negligible changes as compared to 1987. At the same time the portion of the patients registered at the dispensaries reduced from 87.7% in 1987 to 82.2% in 1989. On the contrary, the portion of the patients given medical advice increased from 12.3 to 17.8%. Therefore, to trace the dynamics of mental pathology among the population, revealed by the psychiatric services on the basis of the statistical reports, it is necessary to make use of the total data on the groups of patients placed under dispensary observation and given medical advice. To widen the possibilities of rendering assistance to the latter group patients, it is badly needed that the development of the out-of-dispensary forms of rendering psychiatric assistance be intensified."

The index of fertility and brutto-coefficient of reproductiveness in the group of patients is equal to 30-70% from the level of normal reproductiveness. However, in some forms of pathology (in patients with periodic schizophrenia) the level of reproductiveness falls more slowly than in the general population. It has been established that more than half of the children of schizophrenic patients (50.9%) are born after the onset of the disease. The level of fertility and the number of children or normals depends upon social factors (educational census, family budget).

The nosological structure of mental disorders was studied to reveal that the number of patients with borderline mental conditions, seen at the polyclinic, exceeded that registered at the dispensary. The fundamental principles of the out-of-dispensary psychiatric aid to the patients have been developed: 1--early identification, 2--rational therapeutic interaction, 3--necessity and sufficiency. The use of the differentiated forms and methods of specialized out-of-dispensary psychiatric aid allowed the efficiency of medical and prophylactic measures to be increased and the duration of the temporary loss of work fitness due to mental diseases to be reduced by not less than 68%. It is concluded that the development of the analogous forms of the out-of-dispensary psychiatric aid is advisable and effective."

One hundred and seventy-four veterans, aged 22-43 years who committed criminal actions, were examined. Aggressive criminal behavior was noted in veterans with long-term combat experience, especially in conditions of particular intensity (extreme severity) of combat stress. These people had difficulties in the adaptation to civil life due to the presence of PTSD and characteristic personality changes. In all cases, criminal actions have been committed under an acute stressful situation of different severity associated with the interpersonal conflict (immediately or gradually developed). In these conditions, some PTSD symptoms masked real details of psycho-traumatic conflict situation creating the impression of relentless confrontation."

Left-hemispheric cortical-limbic and diencephalic right-hemispheric syndromes were revealed. Left-hemispheric frontal-temporal-limbic dysfunction was associated with schizophrenia-like syndrome, while diencephalic right-hemispheric dysfunction--with the affective syndrome. Doses more than 0.3 Sv (including the ARS-patients) resulted more frequently in the left-hemispheric cortical-limbic and schizophrenia-like syndromes. Diencephalic right-hemispheric and affective syndromes were more frequently observed after the exposure to doses less [corrected] than 0.3 Sv. Development of schizophrenia spectrum disorders in the irradiated Chernobyl survivors could be due to radiation-induced left fronto-temporal-limbic dysfunction following irradiation doses more than 0.3 Sv (including the ARS-patients). The cerebral patterns of schizophrenia and postradiation brain damage are similar. Persons exposed fo 0.3 Sv and more could be classified as the group of higher risk of the development of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The authors suggest that ionizing radiation may be an environmental trigger factor which can cause schizophrenia in the predisposed subjects."

Evaluation of neurological status, Luria's syndrome neuropsychological analysis for assessment of higher mental functions dynamics (HMF) were carried out. Pre-operative ultrasound duplex scanning of brachio-cephalic arteries and investigation of cerebral perfusion using spiral computed tomography (SCT-perfusion) were done before and 1 day after the surgery. The frequency of intrasurgery stroke in the area of the operated carotid artery was 2.1%. Pre-operative SCT-perfusion revealed the syndrome of cerebral hyperperfusion in 3.1% of patients with higher (>1 s) difference between the average time of blood transition in temporal areas. Dynamics of HMF was the key clinical indicator that allowed to evaluate the course of nearest post-operative phase and to compare it with an area of operated vessel. Changes of HMF were characterized by the decrease in dysfunction of the hemisphere ipsilateral to the side of operation or had differently directed character. The aggravation of HMF disturbances was found in 40% of patients and was represented by syndromes with different topical location. Causes and mechanisms of the development of these changes are discussed."

The patient's psychological state was assessed by MMPI. MVP patients had normal vegetative homeostasis but hyperreactivity of the autonomic nervous system in acute propranolol test; symptomatic patients displayed paradoxical reactions. NCD patients showed sympatheticotonia in rest and normoreactivity in acute propranolol test.

Hence it followed that the elaboration of ethical problems in psychiatry was lagging behind and the introduction of psychotherapy and methods of psychological correction was slow. At present legal issues of psychiatric care are being actively elaborated.

The observations of combinations of different variations of PD in one person as well as the cases of including of elements one variant in the picture of the other one permitted one to suggest the presence of a single pathobiological basis for PD rise."

In accordance with this new principle, the treatment and counselling assistance to persons with mental disorders was rendered only after seeing a doctor. The main results of the experiment are as follows: 1) the follow-up group of patients noticeably diminished at the expense of a decrease of the number of persons taken under the follow-up studies as well as at the expense of more rapid removal of the patients from the register including their active transfer to the patients' group given medical advice; 2) in the follow-up group structure, there was an increase in the number of patients with psychotic disorders and mental retardation and a noticeable lowering of the number of patients with non-psychotic disorders; 3) the group of patients to be given medical advice dramatically increased in the experimental territories, while the number of patients suffering from non-psychotic disorders accounted among them for 80-85%. On the whole the experiment provided evidence in favour of the opportuneness and soundness of introduction into psychiatric practice of the two follow-up types: as far as patients with grave mental disorders and deep social decompensation are concerned, they should be followed up over time by means of conventional methods; as to patients with milder mental disorders, the counselling form of the follow-up is quite sufficient, provided they adapt themselves socially or are well protected (in respect to children and retired persons)."

This review analyzes the immune mechanisms of the development of mental disorders in patients with somatic diseases, in particular, the transmission of an inflammatory signal from the periphery to the CNS and the implementation of the influence of inflammatory factors on neurochemical systems that determine the characteristics of mental functioning. Particular attention is paid to the processes underlying the disruption of the blood-brain barrier caused by peripheral inflammation. Modulation of neurotransmission, changes in neuroplasticity, changes in regional activity of the brain in areas associated with the functions of threat recognition, cognitive processes and memory function, the effect of cytokines on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system are considered as mechanisms of action of inflammatory factors in the brain. The need to take into account variations in the genes of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may be the cause of increased genetic vulnerability associated with the risk mental disorders in patients suffering from a certain somatic disease, is emphasized."

Uncontrolled study with interrupted time series was carried out. According to efficiency of treatment patients were divided into two groups (group 1 (n=21)--very much improved and much improved; group 2 (n=9)--minimally improved). Adamantilbromphenylamine was administered to patients as a monotherapy 100 mg a day for 28 days. Examination was conducted before and after therapy. Severity of asthenic symptoms according to MFI-20 scale was identified; cellular and humoral immunity parameters, mitogen-induced production of interleukins (IL) 1β and IL 4 by immunocompetent cells of patients were assessed. 30 patients with non-psychotic mental disorders with predominance of asthenic symptomatology in clinical picture of the disease were examined. Before therapy every proband had over 60 points across 5 items of MFI-20 scale. As compared with control decrease of number of lymphocytes of CD3+-, HLA-DR+, CD16+-phenotypes; increase in the ratio of CD4+/CD8+; concentration of serum IgM; phagocytic activity of neutrophils were revealed. In the end of therapy in group 1, sum total of points of asthenia decreased up to 26(23-37) (p<0.001); in group 2--up to 57(47-61). Only in group 1 positive dynamic of immune parameters was revealed. It was shown that baseline level of proinflammatory cytokine IL 1β in group with apparent therapeutic effect of the drug was reliably lower, than in group with minimal improvement (p=0.005). These differences remained also after course of therapy (p=0.042). Interrelationship of clinical-immunological effect of adamantilbromphenylamine has been revealed; intensity of production of IL 1β may be considered as a criterion of prognosis of efficiency of treatment with adamantilbromphenylamine in patients with non-psychotic mental disorders."

        "abstract": "The data concerning neurophysiological and neurotransmitter mechanisms of two principal kinds of inhibition of behavior is carried out: the inborn genetically determined inhibition and that developed in the course of training. On the basis of the experiments performed by the author and the literature on general neurophysiology the conclusion is made that development of inhibition of behavior during training (i.e. internal inhibition, including \"latent inhibition\") is determined by the relative strengthening of inhibitory hyperpolarization processes either locally (in a conditioned stimulus analyzer) or globally in the brain cortex and other brain structures during intensification of the inhibitory state (profound inhibition of a reflex and sleep). The main neurotransmitter in development of internal inhibition is gamma-aminobutyric acid. Inhibition of behavior without preliminary training arises either during the action of superstrong stimuli, (exceeding the maximum value inhibition) or during interaction of two and more active systems. A stronger one of these two systems suppresses another one (external inhibition, dominant inhibition, \"freezing\", \"prepulse inhibition\", etc.). These kinds of inhibition develop on the background of EEG activation, which suggests participation in their realization of reticular structures and corresponding neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, noradrenalin, dopamine and serotonin). Behavior pathology causes a break of the balanced interaction between the excitation and inhibition in the central nervous system. This affects both genetically determined forms of behavior inhibition and the learned internal inhibition."

In the framework of this model, the authors suggest to single out three basic stages of the psychosocial rehabilitation process: evaluation and planning, rehabilitation interventions per se, achievement of the result. In author's opinion, the most successful way for constructing a modern model of psychosocial rehabilitation is a method of hierarchic modeling which can reveal a complex chain of interactions between all participants of the rehabilitation process and factors involved in this process and at the same time specify the multi-level hierarchic character of these interactions and factors. An important advantage of this method is the possibility of obtaining as static as well dynamic evaluations of the rehabilitation service activity that may be used on the following levels: 1) patient; 2) his/her close environment; 3) macrosocial level. The obvious merits of the system-oriented model appear to be the possibility of application of its principles in the organization of specialized care for psychiatric patients on the local, regional and federal levels. The authors emphasize that hierarchic models have universal character and can be implemented in the elaboration of information-analytical systems aimed at solving the problems of monitoring and analysis of social-medical service activity in order to increase its effectiveness."

The psychometric assessment included MINI-6, HAMD-17, PHQ-9, PAID, WHO-5. One hundred and seventeen patients (58.5%) have mental disorders. Current mental disorders were diagnosed in 93 (46.5%) of patients. Depression (depressive episode, recurrent depressive disorder, bipolar affective disorder type II) was identified in 34 (17.0%), dysthymia in 26 (13.0%), and anxiety spectrum disorders in 39 (19.5%). In about half of the cases, anxiety disorders were combined with depression. The most severe problems were observed in the patients with depression and dysthymia. Patients with social phobia had significantly higher levels of glycated hemoglobin compared to patients without mental disorders. The significant decrease of systolic arterial pressure and body mass index was observed in patients with agoraphobia compared to patients without mental disorders. In addition, there was an increased prevalence of chronic ischemic heart disease in recurrent depression, dysthymia and generalized anxiety disorder, higher prevalence of neuropathy in depressive episode and recurrent depression and nephropathy in panic disorder. Depressive and anxiety disorders, as well as severe psychosocial problems, are consistently associated with T2DM.

In 1965, 2188.5 thousand patients were on the books at the PND in this country, whereas in 1987, their number rose to 10201.3 thousand. Therefore, during 22 years the number of mental patients increased 4.7-fold. The greatest increase is recorded among patients suffering from schizophrenia and psychopathy. This tendency is characteristic of all the republics. At the same time the disability rate among schizophrenic patients dropped (possibly at the expense of a more favorable course of this pathology). The authors point out that this country ranks ninth in the world in the number of psychiatrists per 1000 population. As far as the number of beds for mental patients is concerned, it occupies the 23d place. From 1985 to 1988, the load of the dispensary psychiatrist reduced from 565 to 520 patients, i.e. it diminished by 8%. On the whole the psychiatric services render assistance to 4% of the population of this country today."

Mental status was assessed using Hamilton scale and the frontotemporal dementia scale. Mental disorders were identified in 101 (85%) of AMS patients and in 51 (52.5%) of their family members. The patients had situational disorders, with a slight prevalence of situational depression. Sometimes AMS was comorbid to endogenous mental diseases. Cognitive impairment that reached the diagnostic threshold of dementia was observed in 4.2% of the patients. The family members had only situational disorders with distinct predominance (28%) of anxiety states. Common intoxications (tobacco smoking, drug addiction etc) were noted in 49 (41.5%) of AMS patients and 80 (82.4%) of their family members. Anxiety and other mental disorders often resulted in the noncompliance with physician recommendation and refusal of treatment. Permanent patronage of AMC families by specialists of neurologic and psychotherapeutic services and assistance based on the mental state and general medical situation are recommended."

Its originality is seen in the fact that practically all speaking and writing about it noted the importance of this principle for the protection of rights and legal interests of citizens, failing into the field of psychiatry. However, expressing this opinion, doctors and lawyers offer very few arguments in support of this view. Traditional arguments in favor of the presumption of mental health, scattered and unsystematic, prove to be absolutely insolvent. It was also found out that the similarity of the presumption of mental health with the presumption of innocence is capable to entail negative consequences. The noted similarity strengthens stigmatizing effect of psychiatric diagnosis, making it extremely undesirable for the patient, and the basis of the relationship between the patient and the doctor laid counterproductive antagonistic model as the model of mutual relations of the accused with the prosecutor. The main conclusion of authors is that the supporters of the presumption of mental health have yet to prove its right to exist, to work out its content and try to neutralize some of the negative consequences of its possible implementation in practice. Without compliance with the listed conditions to bring the presumption of mental health to the level of one of the fundamental principles of Russian psychiatry would be premature."

Social distancing by clinicians is an integral part of the stigmatization that depends on the behavior of the patient and the level of awareness of the clinician. The modified Bogardus Social Distance Self-Assessment Scale (BSDS) was used to evaluate the indicators of social distance phenomena. The assessment was performed by clinicians for the following groups of patients with the following mental disorders: alcohol use disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, drug addiction, epilepsy, mental retardation, schizophrenia. All statistical calculations were performed using IBM SPSS-27 software (IBM Corp. 2021, licensed to Samara State Medical University). P-value ≤ 0.05 was determined as significant for the between-group (PSY vs NPHP) comparisons using a nonparametric Wilcoxon test. The study included 141 clinicians: PSY (n=20; 36.2±4.2 y.o.) and NPHP (n=121; 25.9±2.2 y.o.). The NPHP group included general practitioners (GP)/physicians (n=29; 20.6%), surgeons (n=19; 13.5%), obstetrician-gynecologists (n=26; 18.4%), neurologists (n=11; 7.8%), pediatricians (n=6; 4.3%), and other subspecialists (including urologists, tuberculosis specialists, ophthalmologists, and dermatologists) (n=30; 21.3%). The study included 141 students at the Samara State Medical University who were trained in psychiatry. An anonymous survey was conducted on the BSDS scale before and after training. Our analysis of the data showed that the social distance of clinicians in terms of coverage reaches different values depending on the mental disorder, but with common trends both before and after the psychiatry training course. Mean (SD) social distance scores recurred from 2.8 (1.3) for bipolar disorder to 5.3 (1.5) for addiction in the predevelopment group and 2.9 (1.3), 5.4 (1.4) in the group of clinicians after training, respectively. Social distancing scores among clinicians in contemporary Russia were highest for drug addicts, and lowest for depression and bipolar disorder. Stigmatization among clinicians appears to affect the delivery of care to certain categories of patients, which requires further study. Higher social distance scores in patients with drug addiction may be associated with higher stigma and lack of compassion towards these patients. Conversely, lower rates of social distancing and the corresponding emotional acceptance of people with depression and bipolar disorder by clinicians may interfere with timely diagnosis and the availability of appropriate early, treatable care. The awareness of clinicians regarding psychopathological manifestations does not affect the level of social distance, but increases it in relation to mentally healthy individuals with normal behavior."

Clinical follow-up of the patients was supplemented by computer-aided tomography in 40 cases and electroencephalo-, rheoencephalo- and echoencephalography in 25 cases. Twenty-five patients were subjected to experimental and psychological examination. Follow-up for as long as 4 years was conducted in 56 patients. The main syndromes of psychic disorders in MS patients were as follows: neurosis-like disturbances (asthenic, hysteriform and obsessive syndromes), affective disturbances (apathic and anxiety depression, euphoria without decreased intellect), as well as organic oligophrenia, psychotic states and epileptiform syndrome in the initial status. Structural changes in the brain were found to be the principal factor in the genesis of the described disorders. The authors propose a differential approach to the treatment of the identified disorders including the use of tranquilizers, antidepressants, neuroleptics and nootropic drugs, as well as methods of rational psychotherapy."

Patients with diagnosed schizophrenia, along with hypertension and diabetes mellitus, have found to be at increased risk of diseases of the endocrine system and metabolic disorders. The incidence of the mentioned diseases is not higher than that reported in literature. The higher prevalence of socially relevant diseases (hypertension, diabetes mellitus) among patients with mental disorders demands the development of strategies for prevention, early detection and treatment of these diseases in psychiatric patients."

It was appeared the diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders which still based only on clinical symptoms. Whether psychotic disorders can be better represented dimensionally or categorically remains a challenging question. Regarding schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, there are some important changes in DSM-5 and ICD-11 concerning the use of quantitative assessment of psychopathological domains, course of psychosis and remission as well as giving more attention to cognitive issues. The main differences between these classifications are the structure of corresponding sections and different criteria of some disorders. Before the ICD-11 implementation in 2022 into clinical practice, it is highly recommended to conduct a set of trainings for clinicians along with the comments to Diagnostic guidelines for Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders."

Although clinically useful, current diagnostic systems for psychiatry cause concerns due to the lack of biological mechanisms. Deciphering the relationships among psychiatric traits according to their genetic basis may facilitate understanding the biological mechanisms of psychiatric disorders. Ten mental disorders were classified by genomic structural equation modeling (SEM), which leverages summary results of genome-wide association studies. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anorexia nervosa (AN), anxiety disorder (ANX), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia (SZ), and Tourette syndrome (TS) were included. The analysis indicates that they are genetically inter-correlated with one another and can be separated based on their general psychopathology. Most disorders have a close partner, forming pairs of traits; only TS is a relatively distinctive condition. At a higher level, MDD, ANX, ADHD, ASD, and PTSD cluster together, while OCD, AN, and TS cluster together. Together, the ten traits constitute a hierarchical classificatory system. This study allows inference of genetically determined classification of the ten mental disorders, which may biologically inform the current diagnostic framework and treatment regimens for mental disorders."

Some of RF predisposing factors (female sex, frequent nasopharyngeal infections, poor housing and occupational conditions) negatively affect outcomes of primary RF and contribute to emergence of valvular disease. The initial attack of activity I or III degree, pronounced carditis, active rheumatic process at discharge, recurrences, absence of year-round prophylaxis allow prognostication of valvular heart disease. The majority of the factors promoting valvular and circulatory disorders also contribute to the onset of psychic abnormalities, astheno-organic syndrome, in particular."

In the case of psychoses development, there was a tendency toward the alleviation of the acuity of every subsequent reactive condition. Such disorders as acute reactive psychoses, reactive depression, delirium-like fantasies showed a progressive tendency to decline, while there was an increase in the incidence of pseudodementia, reactive paranoid and verbal hallucinosis. Conditions contributing to the development of individual types of psychoses are reviewed."

        "abstract": "The study included 60 patients aged 18-65 years with anxious-phobic disorder (APD)--agoraphobia with and without panic disorders. Diagnosis of the disease was performed according to ICD-10. It was established that dynamics and outcome of APD with stable agoraphobia depend on some comorbid psychic disorders (neurotic, nonpsychotic affective, personality disorders, slow-progredient schizophrenia). Influence of such disorders on APD depends on level of realization of the comorbid correlations: symptomatic (nondelirious hypochondria) and intersyndromal ones (affective and personal disorders as well as slow-progredient schizophrenia). Typology of APD with stable agoraphobia is proposed, that is determined by comorbid correlations with the phenomena of nondelirious (overvaluable or neurotic) hypochondria. Agoraphobia, comorbid with the phenomena of overvaluable hypochondria, is characterized by isolated phobic avoidance (1-2 situations), lack of the signs of progredience of psychopathologic disorders and relatively favourable outcome (lack of the cases of invalidism, decrease of a professional status in 8% of the patients). Agoraphobia, comorbid with the phenomena of neurotic hypochondria, is characterized by total phobic avoidance, syndromal comorbidity with polymorphic and generalized somatophormic disorders, depressive disorders syndromally completed, slow-progredient schizophrenia and less favourable outcome (avoidance behaviour of severe degrees was found in 57% of the patients, including 18% of patients disabled due to mental disease)."

At the same time the social aspects of labor relations act as the most important factors influencing on the workers' self-assessment of health status. Quantitative risk assessment of the common pathological syndromes has identified the excess of share of persons with a minimum level of risk over the medium and high. In the structure of risks of common pathological syndromes there are prevailed risks for disorders of the cardiovascular and nervous systems and borderline mental disorders, which is a response to the impact of not only industrial, but also psychosocial factors. The results of self-assessment of health status and clinical examination of employees in conditions of mercury exposure show the similarity of the structure of diseases in these cases. In either event there are dominated diseases of the nervous and mental sphere, and from the comorbid pathology disorders of the cardiovascular system are prove to be important. Clinical manifestations of the mercury exposure, ranging from pre-clinical manifestations to marked changes from the side of the nervous system in toxic encephalopathy, are characterized by the presence of hyperkinetic syndrome. For pre-clinical and early forms of mercury poisoning there is also typical the presence of asthenic (emotional lability) disorders with autonomic dysfunction. Comorbidities in an internship working was manifested primarily by diseases of visual organs, cardiovascular system and diseases of the musculoskeletal system. Observed disorders of the nervous system and psycho-emotional sphere are caused, inter alia disturbances of the balance of catecholamines (the rise of norepinephrine in dynamics with a concomitant increase in the coefficient reflecting the degree of its metabolism: norepinephrine/epinephrine and norepinephrine/(adrenaline + Normetanephrine)) in the body."

It was found that a considerable role in the development of borderline psychic disorders belongs to both somatic disturbances due to low-dose radiation and psychogenic effects. A combined action of psychogenic and somatogenic factors aggravated symptoms of neurotic disorders and promoted widening of a range of psychic disturbances. Some part of the population from the contaminated territories tended to the development of cerebro-vascular psychoorganic pathology resultant from a breakdown of the reserves of the adaptation.

Heart rate variability (taking into account very low-frequency (VLF, 0.003-0.04 Hz), low-frequency (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz), and high-frequency (HF, 0.15-0.40 Hz) components) was computed from the power spectra (5-min epochs) of the EKG recorded in the patients in supine position. After the treatment, the HF power of the heart rate variability (an index of cardiac parasympathetic activity) increased (p < 0.05), whereas the VLF power (an index of the cerebral sympathetic activity) decreased (p < 0.01). The decrease in the VLF was accompanied by a reduction of anxiety level (p < 0.01).

Psychiatrists realized emergent and planned consultations of the mentally-ill patients in all hospital departments, conducted, in addition to general treatment, psychopharmacotherapy and psychotherapy or directed them, on demand, to psychiatric hospitals. For the 3-year period, the psychiatrists have consulted 4685 somatic patients with comorbid mental diseases (5% of the total amount of the patients admitted to the hospital at that period), 1360 patients (29%) being affected with psychotic disorders. One hundred eighty two patients were diagnosed to have schizophrenia, 784--arteriosclerosis and old-age psychosis and dementia, 45--reactive psychosis, 16--epilepsy (disphoria and psychotic episodes), 67--mental retardation with inadequate behavior, 266--delirium of alcoholic and drug addiction genesis. In some cases, usage of psychotropics, in combination with psychotherapy, has resulted in recovery or considerable psychic state improvement in 9.1% of the patients, improvement in 52% ones, insignificant improvement in 36%. In 2.9% of the cases, the effect of treatment has not been achieved."

Group I included women with mental disorders accompanying vasomotor manifestations of the climacteric syndrome. To prevent and treat these disorders, of great importance is their diagnosis at the initial stage in the premenopausal period, particularly within the framework of the premenstrual syndrome. It is pathogenetically justified that this group patients be administered replacement hormonal therapy. Still, if mental disorders are aggravated, the hormonal drugs or their combinations with psychotropic agents should be withdrawn. Group II included women with psychogenous and endogenous mental diseases that occurred for the first time in the climacteric period. In this group patients, hormonal therapy should be withdrawn to prevent exacerbation of the health status and adequate treatment be instituted."

Psychotherapeutic work involved certain form of drama therapy that included patients watching Moscow theaters performances and then discussing them with family and in group therapy sessions with psychologists. Researchers have developed drama therapy methods for children with mental disorders, determined indications and contraindications for this treatment. The study shows effects of art therapy on the child adaptation to the conditions of the micro-social environment, particularly on his family adaptation, formation of harmonious, supportive, rehabilitative family relations. It is noted that art therapy influences adolescent's adaptation to the conditions of the macrosocial environment, particularly his adaptation in a peer group, behavior in various situations and formation of normal behavioral patterns in different environmental conditions."

The study comprised 3 groups: 1st--subjects with stable psychic adaptation, 2nd--subjects with unstable psychic adaptation, a risk group, 3rd--subjects with stable psychic disadaptation, i.e. with some borderline mental disorders (BMD). Significant differences in the prevalence of psychic adaptation and disadaptation among groups under study were found. The predominance of the 2nd and 3rd groups among lorry-drivers in comparison with control group was found. The results showed that social and demographic characteristics had no significant influence neither in experimental nor in control groups (p > 0.1). Variability of psychoemotional imbalance levels among lorry-drivers was found to be due to a combination of the following factors: occupational exposure and their work schedule, while in control group--to the age of metal craftsmen. Comparative analysis of neurobehavioral disorders revealed the predominance of the asthenic symptoms, anxious and depressive manifestations, hysterical reactions among lorry-drivers, and the vegetative disorders only in control group. The results thus obtained support the hypothesis of occupational hazards and long driving experience being the risk factors for the development of BMD. The application of bioregulating peptides was found to restore the organism adaptive potential, improved psychoemotional indices, intensified resistance to work stress and reduced occupational risk of borderline mental disorders (p < 0.001-0.05). The best effect was obtained in case of combined application of several cytogens (pinealon and vezugen), which were optimally selected regarding the effect of each adverse occupational factor on a target organ or system. The employed parameters of psychoemotional state were rather informative for assessing the peptidergic properties of cytogens in occupational medicine and geriatrics."

Two types of reminiscences were identified: review, reevaluation of the past life in 13 and spontaneous reminiscences of the long past in 32 subjects. The latter were characterized by fragmentality, sensual vividness, not infrequently by emotional neutrality. They were in fair correlation with the age and the level of mental activity. It was proved that the realization of old mnemonic material becomes biologically easier in old age. It is postulated that this property of senile psyche may serve as a prerequisite for the development of the pathological symptom, a shift of the situation into the past, which is constant in senile dementia and transient in other psychopathological states in advanced age."

The method is attractive due to non-invasiveness, availability of equipment with a wide range of modifications for various purposes, and the ability to track the dynamics of brain electrical activity directly and with high temporal resolution. Spectral, coherency and other types of analysis provide volumetric information about its power, frequency distribution, spatial organization of signal and its self-similarity in dynamics or in different sections at a time. The development of computing technologies provides processing of volumetric data obtained using EEG and a qualitatively new level of their analysis using various mathematical models. This review discusses benefits and limitations of using the EEG in scientific research, currently known interpretation of the obtained data and its physiological and pathological correlates. It is expected to determine the complex relationship between the parameters of brain electrical activity and various functional and pathological conditions. The possibility of using EEG characteristics as biomarkers of various physiological and pathological conditions is being considered. Electronic databases, including MEDLINE (on PubMed), Google Scholar and Russian Scientific Citation Index (RSCI, on elibrary.ru), scientific journals and books were searched to find relevant studies."

Gender effects on the scales' scores were more numerous and stronger than age. No SES differences were found. Russian children reported more problems than children of other nationalities did. Compared with American children, Russians were lower on competencies and higher on Somatic complaints and self-reported behavioural problems. On competence scales, Russian children in an unselected sample scored themselves lower than American children in a clinical sample. It is supposed that low self-esteem may be the first effect of the unfavourable development in Russian adolescents."

        "abstract": "In recent decades, psychiatric ethics has been an area of intensive research and reconsideration of established regulations. Basic principles of medical deontology do not cover ethical issues of modern psychiatric science and practice. The fundamental principle of ethical relationship between a physician and a patient in psychiatric practice is a voluntary informed consent that is based on three main criteria: voluntarism, decision-making capacity and information disclosure about proposed medical procedure. The principle of voluntary informed consent implies a dialogue between a psychiatrist and a patient that rely on the principles of patient's autonomy and does not allow the priority of the paternalistic approach. The physician is obliged to provide all available information on the proposed intervention in a comprehensive way and assess the degree of patient's awareness of this information. The main objective is to determine patient's ability to make decisions as accurately as possible. Many mental disorders affect cognitive processes of decision making and may impact patient's autonomy. It is unacceptable to consider psychiatric patients as incapable of making decisions in advance."

They have distinct clinical features that confer information about suicidal risk, allow to differentiate therapeutic tactics and indicate a role of psychogeny and psychotic disorders in the development of external forms of suicidal behavior."

        "abstract": "Examination of patients observed at a general somatic outpatient centre showed that 31.2% of the patients had mental disorders of the borderline level. Most commonly occurring among the psychopathological syndromes were atypical affective conditions with definite somatization of mental disturbances, which was expressed in massive somatic sensations (senestopathies), vegetative irregularities, and somatic pathology of the functional character. Such conditions made up 62.7%. The given syndromologic type is defined as senestopathic-hypochondriac depression which is subdivided into two variants depending on the nature of the symptomatology. The study has shown that the revealed psychopathological syndromes of the borderline level predominantly refer to the endogenic process of low intensity and less frequently to personality pathology at the stage of decompensation."

The clinical manifestations that contributed to the discharge from the army appeared to vary. In part of the examined, the status could be regarded as decompensation with steady pathocharacterological reactions and neurotic disorders (in accentuated personalities). The time-course of changes in psychopathy formation depended on its variant, namely on the main \"nucleus\" of the personality. In unstable and inhibited persons, the time-course of changes in the illness turned out to be the most favourable. The conditions and possible mechanisms of different variants of the time-course of changes in personality disorders have been delineated for the three main clinical groups under study: excitable, inhibited and unstable."

The asthenic syndrome with marked vegetative disturbances was the most prominent feature in the clinical picture. Patients with hepatic cirrhosis were characterized by a more severe asthenia and greater intensity of vegetative symptomatology as compared to patients with an extrahepatic form of portal hypertension. Characteristic of psychotic disorders in liver cirrhosis was severity of the psychoorganic syndrome. Personality shifts with the predominance of explosiveness, epilepsy- and paranoia-like tendencies grow with disease progression. Surgical treatment by constructing vascular anastomoses occasionally leads to intensification of the psychoorganic syndrome in cirrhosis patients and to its appearance in patients with extrahepatic portal hypertension, which calls for the development of more clear-cut indications for such surgery."

Cognitive insight, although not linked to objective indicators of ultra-high risk for schizophrenia, predicts a decline in both total score of SOPS, and in the Positive symptoms subscale during the treatment of patients with personality disorders. In the groups with mood disorders and schizotypal disorder, cognitive insight reflects more anxiety and uncertainty related to patients' experience rather than the true conscious criticism.

Results of the psychopathological study of 42 patients with schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD), with well-marked signs of AID in the course of the disease (22 sub. - infantilism; 20 sub. - puerilism), are summarized. Psychometric evaluation was carried out using a standardized block of pathopsychological methods; scales for assessing negative and positive psychopathological symptoms (SANS, PANSS, MFI-20); personality assessment instruments (SPQ-A; Personality Traits Questionnaire (V. Rusalova); Methods for diagnostics of personal maturity (V. Ruzhenkova)). The differentiation between infantilism and puerilism, forming in the psychopathological space of schizophrenia and SSD, is not limited by differences in the indicators of age-related immaturity. Infantilism shows an affinity to the dimensional structures of the negative symptoms, acting as primary psychopathological formations - apathoabulic disorders. Conversely, puerilism is derived from the positive symptoms - psychopathological formations related to the dissociative disorders. From the perspective of the modern concept of schizophrenia, infantilism and puerilism are associated with polar dimensional structures (positive-negative symptoms) and, accordingly, can be regarded as psychopathologically heterogeneous formations."

We used official demographic and socio-economic data at the population level, as well as analytical data from specialized medical and research institutions. Methods of systemic data analysis and statistical analysis were used to develop linear models of the relationship between the factors and BMD incidence rates. The least squares method was used to build a nonlinear logistic model of the BMD prevalence in the population using the MS Excel Solver add-in. Socio-economic and demographic factors that significantly affect the BMD prevalence and incidence in the period under review have been identified. Regression linear models with a high level of significance for the BMD incidence and prevalence in the Russian population in the period 1992-2022 were developed. A logistic model has been developed to predict the prevalence of BMD with changes in the human resources of mental health care and the population size. The logistic model was used to estimate the marginal level of BMD prevalence for the Russian population. Examples of the use of the obtained models to predict incidence rates are given. Operational (using linear models) and long-term (based on the logistic model) estimates of BMD incidence and prevalence in the Russian population make it possible to consider the influence of demographic and socio-economic factors on the population's life and the human resources of the mental care system."

Excessive daytime sleepiness is present in 15.6% of adults in the world, a Russian study showed a prevalence of 39.2%. It is associated with a wide range of comorbidities, including obesity and mental disorders, on the other hand, the presence of hypersomnia increases the likelihood of mental illness. People with hypersomnia are more likely to take medications, have a decreased quality of life, spend more health care resources, and more often receive social benefits. The heritability is estimated to be about 40% for sleep duration and 17% for excessive daytime sleepiness. Hypersomnia in mental disorders is secondary. It most often occurs in patients with depression or bipolar disorder. To assess the severity of daytime sleepiness, self-observation and objective methods, including the multiple sleep latency test, actigraphy, polysomnography, are used. In the differential diagnosis of hypersomnia in psychiatric disorders, it is necessary to make a differential diagnosis with hypersomnia caused by taking medications or other substances and insufficient sleep syndrome. The etiology of prolonged sleep in psychiatric disorders is complex, and includes biological and psychological causes. The relationship between self-reported hypersomnia and sleep actually obtained is still unclear. Results of daily polysomnography show a significant increase in time in bed during the day and night (clinophilia). Therapy of hypersomniac syndromes should be done taking into account the etiology of the disease. In cases of secondary nature, the main efforts should be directed to the treatment of the underlying mental disorder causing somnolence."

The regularities of development of mental disorder in judicially significant situations with regard to the influence of different types of psychogenic factors (specific sexual traumatization, additional and concomitant factors, non-specific psychogenic factors) are described. Definitions of different variants of cause-effect relationships (directed, modified) are formulated. The author suggests the grounds for choosing a form (definite, probable) of expert conclusion."

Interneuronal interaction mechanisms in neuronal networks have the same type in pathological conditions and physiological activity of the brain. Methods of overcoming the sustainable functional state are aimed at the destruction of formed interneuronal networks and subsequent restructuring interneuronal interactions de novo. Search for endogenous biochemical markers of pathology under the condition of functional stability of interneuronal interactions can not be considered as a perspective direction for the detection of a pathognomonic sign of a specific brain pathology. The author argues that all known methods of non-drug exposure used today (magnetic and electrical stimulation, neurotransplantants, deafferentation, etc.) and methods with historical significance (comatose therapy, pyrotherapy) have a similar effect aimed at the destruction of pathological interneuronal interactions."

Mental patients showed a greater rigidity of these structures which remained unaltered even with the arrival of newcomers, which is explained by a relatively minor role played by such a factor as socialization. The nosological characteristics influenced the sociometric choices only indirectly, with the main structural factors being sex and age. The position of each patient in this structure was altered in parallel with the change in his or her mental status. Unlike the therapeutic department, characteristic of mentally ill patients was the limitation of choices by sex; they also differed by the fact that girls had two types of leaders."

In our review, we consider the previous main stages in the psychosomatic medicine and the prospective approaches to its further study. Evaluation of the etiopathogenesis of the entire set of mental and somatic symptoms in their interaction and dynamics can help identify individual subpopulations of patients with shared pathobiochemical and neurophysiological disorders. The recent interpretation of the biopsychosocial model is mainly related to the etiology and pathogenesis of mental disorders and also provides a good perspective for research on these issues. Today, there are sufficient opportunities to study all three domains of the model. Productive study of the biological, personal and social domains is also possible on the base of evidence-based design using modern research technologies."

Information about patient's gender, age, doctor's diagnosis according to International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, and the date of call were recorded. Pearson's Chi-squared tests were used for comparing proportions of ambulance calls across the week for CVDs (I00-99), mental and behavioral disorders (F00-F99), and external causes (S00-T98, V01-Y98). The ratio of incidence of ambulance calls on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday versus the rest of week was also calculated. There is a significant daily variation (p < 0.001) in calls for CVDs in men and women aged 18-59 and women aged 60 years and older, with increased numbers of calls on weekends and Mondays varying between 2 and 3% excess calls. For mental and behavioral disorders, a similar pattern was found in the age group of 18-59 year-olds. Ratios for the number of calls during weekends and Mondays vs. the rest of the week were 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02-1.08) among women and 1.02 (95% CI: 1.00-1.05) among men. For external causes, a significant variation and an increase in ambulance calls during Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays from 4 to 17% excess calls was observed for both age and gender groups. The observed daily variations in ambulance calls with an increased number of calls on weekends and Mondays for CVDs, mental and behavioral disorders, and external causes may be associated with excessive alcohol consumption on the weekends.

The study included 83 patients of a psycho-neurological institution prone to commit SDA. The comparison group consisted of 88 mental patients who were not inclined to commit SDA. The material was collected using the method of anonymous survey according to the «Questionnaire for the Study of Satisfaction of the Population with Inpatient Medical Care». To interpret the data, quantitative and qualitative indicators were calculated. Satisfaction with treatment in consumers of psychiatric services is high, reaching 96.4% (<i>n</i>=80) in the main group and 97.7% (<i>n</i>=86) in the comparison group. Doctors' knowledge (95.2%, <i>n</i>=79 and 97.7%, <i>n</i>=86) and the level of trust in them (86.8%, <i>n</i>=72 and 90.9%, <i>n</i>=80) received the highest share of positive assessments by the patients. However, patients who are prone to commit SDA rate lower both medical care in general (68.7%, <i>n</i>=57 vs. 90.9%, <i>n</i>=80) and its individual parameters. Thus, 71.1% (<i>n</i>=59) believe that the doctor does not perceive them as an independent person, does not devote enough time to them (41%, <i>n</i>=34). In the comparison group, there are fewer such answers (11.4%, <i>n</i>=10; 4.5%, <i>n</i>=4). Patients highly (89.2%, <i>n</i>=74 and 94.3%, <i>n</i>=83) rate the living conditions in the hospital. The perceived quality of medical care is influenced by three groups of factors: the characteristics of consumers of medical services, the possibilities for using health services, the assessed and perceived need for medical services. Equally important is the study of contextual factors in the use of mental health services. The formation of a trusting relationship between the patient and the doctor and ensuring the latter maintain medical secrecy contributes to strengthening social interaction and, as a result, reducing the feeling of coercion, increasing internal motivation and satisfaction with the quality of treatment."

The first two types of dynamics, which appear as as actualization of pathocharacterological formations in the pattern of mental disorders, reflect decompensation processes. In neurotic personality (emotionally labile, anxious, dependent, sensitive schizoids, etc) there is a deep (in terms of personality development) reorganization of characterological abnormalies. In borderline personality (paranoid, expansive schizoids, anancasts, borderline, etc.), aggravation and chronic pattern of mental disorders occurs with dynamics of PD-associated quasipsychoses. The third type of dynamics is not accompanied by aggravation of pathocharacterological manifestations and reflects compensation process. Separation of the isolated symptom complexes, PD derivatives (steady-state catathymically charged pathocharacterological formations are symptom-forming) is possible in any type of personality organization, but more frequently is observed at complex forms with a high proportion of facultative complexes and accentuations."

However; individual characteristics of a patient, such as comorbidities and personality status are frequently disregarded. This work was aimed to study clinical and psychological peculiarities of patients with CHF determining treatment compliance taking account of comorbidity. The study included 203 patients (130 men and 73 women) of mean age 61.8 ± 9.6 yr. The following features were evaluated: comorbidity psychological status, compliance with medicamental and non-medicamental treatment of CHF. Charlson comorbidity index corrected for age was 5.0 ± 2.1. Compliance with non-medicamental (recommendations on self-control and changes in the lifestyle) and medicamental therapy was documented in 37 (18.2%) and 61 (30%) patients respectively. Patients with poor compliance were characterised by disadaptive type of responsiveness, emotional lability and indecisiveness (p < 0.04). Poor treatment compliance is to a large extent determined by peculiarities of the personality status."

The article presents a case with an emphasis on the features of diagnosis and drug treatment of an acute psychotic state, which developed several years after the diagnosis of MS. Considering the rarity of organic delusional disorder in connection with MS and the limited number of scientific studies, as well as the difficulty of selecting antipsychotic drugs, the case helps to highlight the features of diagnosing and selecting pathogenetic therapy for an acute psychotic state."

Affective disorders (neurotic and hypopsychotic depressions) were mostly recorded among mental disorders. The life quality determined in accordance with the self-estimation of the \"health\" and happiness\" noticeably depended both on biological factors (pain intensity, the degree of damage to the bones and joints, and the disease stage) and on social factors--the educational level and social position. The degree of personality merits defined according to the self-estimation of the \"mentality\" and \"character\" appeared higher in persons with higher education and in patients suffering from erosive arthritis.

The first signs of mental illness appeared at the age of 14; over the past 8 years, the disease has been continuous and manifests itself in the form of a predominantly depressive state with increasing severity and complication of symptoms. Throughout all the years of the disease, active psychopharmacotherapy was carried out, combinations of antidepressants with antipsychotics and mood stabilizers were used, but no pronounced effect was achieved. Inpatient treatment in the clinic of the Mental Health Research Center for 5 months using several methods of enhancing antidepressant therapy had a good therapeutic effect and made it possible to achieve complete remission of the disease. There was a normalization of laboratory parameters of cortisol along with a decrease in the severity of pathopsychological symptoms, which indicates the genesis of hypercortisolism secondary to mental illness and its functional nature. It is assumed that hypercortisolism in this patient contributed to the formation of atypical clinical symptoms and resistance to antidepressant therapy. The discussion substantiates the need to consult a psychiatrist in case of persistent hypercortisolism in the absence of clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome. The detection of persistent hypercortisolism in patients with depression determines the advisability of active therapy using several tactics to enhance the effect of antidepressants."

This multicenter cross-sectional study included 178 patients with mood disorders, of which 78.1% (<i>n</i>=139) were women. The diagnosis of BD was made in 68.0% (<i>n</i>=121) patients, of them 37.1% (<i>n</i>=66) were diagnosed with BD type I. All study participants underwent a structured Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview to verify the clinical diagnosis and identify concomitant mental disorders, and also filled out an electronic case report form. Statistical analysis was performed in RStudio v. 1.4.1717 using the standard R package and the «psych» package. According to the results of stepwise regression, comorbid diagnoses of panic disorder (OR=5.3; 95% CI 1.9-19.1) and eating disorders (OR=7.7; 95% CI 2.8-27.4) were more associated with BD. In addition, depressive episodes in BD were more associated with symptoms of hypersomnia (OR=2.5; 95% CI 1.2-5.3) and psychomotor retardation (OR=3.2; 95% CI 1.5-7.6). Symptoms such as increased appetite (47.1% (<i>n</i>=57) vs 26.3% (<i>n</i>=15); <i>p</i>=0.009), ideas of guilt (92.6% (<i>n</i>=112) vs 7.2% (<i>n</i>=44); <i>p</i>=0.006) and thoughts of self-harm or death (70.2% (<i>n</i>=85) vs 45.6% (<i>n</i>=25); <i>p</i>=0.003) were also nominally more common in depressive episodes within the BD compared to MDD. Mood disorders such as BD and MDD have significant differences in the patterns of comorbidity and the structure of depressive episodes, which is important to consider when conducting differential diagnosis of these disorders. The results also indicate the need for a comprehensive diagnostic interview with patients with mood disorders to assess the presence of comorbid mental disorders during life and the structure of depressive episodes throughout the clinical course from the moment of onset."

This review takes into account new data on resolution of inflammation and action of mediators of resolution in models of depression. New facts and ideas about mechanisms of chronic inflammation onset are considered in relation to mood disorders. Basic control mechanisms of inflammation at the cellular level and the role of resolution substances in regulation of depression and other mood disorders are discussed. Signaling systems of innate immunity located in non-immune cells and their ability to generate substances that affect an onset of depression are reviewed.

As regards the structure and development these disorders were not related to the disease that followed. The character of the dysfunctional states, progress of the disease, syndromic manifestations during active period and marked negative changes during the remission seemed to be linked. In patients with early dysfunctional states, the disease ran a more favourable course. Greater severity, systemic character as well as symptomatic features marked early dysfunctional states in patients with schizophrenia as compared to those seen in neurotic patients. Early dysfunctional states are assumed to be a manifestation of instability of the functional systems as a result of their concealed reconstruction during latent disease stage."

The Group of Twenty (G20) member nations, which represent the largest economies globally, should come together to formulate a plan on how to overcome this burden. The Neuroscience-20 (N20) initiative of the Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics (SBMT) is at the vanguard of this global collaboration to comprehensively raise awareness about brain, spine, and mental disorders worldwide. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the various brain initiatives worldwide and highlight the need for cooperation and recommend ways to bring down costs associated with the discovery and treatment of neurological disorders. Our systematic search revealed that the cost of neurological and psychiatric disorders to the world economy by 2030 is roughly $16T. The cost to the economy of the United States is $1.5T annually and growing given the impact of COVID-19. We also discovered there is a shortfall of effective collaboration between nations and a lack of resources in developing countries. Current statistical analyses on the cost of neurological disorders to the world economy strongly suggest that there is a great need for investment in neurotechnology and innovation or fast-tracking therapeutics and diagnostics to curb these costs. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, SBMT, through this paper, intends to showcase the importance of worldwide collaborations to reduce the population's economic and health burden, specifically regarding neurological/brain, spine, and mental disorders."

Despite a high prevalence and extensive clinical studies, the fundamental mechanisms of FASD are still poorly understood. Thereby, experimental models, which allow better control for both socio-environmental and genetic factors, are critical to our understanding of FASD. The review is focused on the effects of exposure to alcohol during the prenatal period in animal models. The authors outline that prenatally alcohol-induced changes in motor and executive functions, learning and memory, stress reactivity and affective state are remarkably parallel between animals and humans.

Throughout the 10-year follow-up, among children with psychoses, boys were prevalent: an average ratio of boys to girls being 3.4:1. In Saint Petersburg, there has been recently a steady reduction in the number of children with psychosis admitted to hospitals, the number patients treated in the outpatient setting being on the increase. At the same time the rates of rehospitalizations are also on the rise of patients mainly with severest psychoses. In the past 10 years, Saint Petersburg has been a town of a steady rise in the number of disabled individuals due to mental diseases among children with schizophrenia and dementia admitted to the hospital."

        "abstract": "To compare the methods and motives of non-suicidal self-injurious behavior (NSIB) in conduct disorders and schizotypal disorder. The main group consisted of 91 patients (77.8%), aged 13-24 years, with behavioral disorders and NSIB, who completed questionnaires using the self-harm statements questionnaire. The younger subgroup consisted of 54 patients under the age of 18 with a diagnosis of «Behavior Disorders» (ICD-10 F91), the older subgroup included 37 patients aged 18 years or more with a diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (F60.3). The comparison group consisted of 100 patients, aged 13-41 years with a diagnosis of schizotypal disorder (F21) and NSIB. We used clinical-psychopathological, standardized and statistical methods. Significant differences were revealed in the sexual preference for NSIB (<i>p</i>=0.0001), a number of leading types of NSIB, and the absence of differences in the motives of self-injurious behavior in patients of the compared groups. In the comparison group, cuts and cauterization prevailed as the leading type of NSIB, in patients with behavioral disorders prevailed obstacles to wound healing, which is hypothetically associated with the influence of obsessive psychopathological mechanisms, since pathological excoriation has the same nature as obsessive-compulsive disorder and is included with it in the same DSM-5 category. The impulsive subtype of NSIB observed in this situation usually arises due to an increasing sense of tension and is associated with the motive of intrapersonal self-regulation. The study showed that the difference between the compared nosological groups according to the methods and motives of self-harming actions is determined not so much by intergroup differences as by sex and age patterns within each of the compared groups. This allows us to talk about the proximity of the mechanisms of self-harm in various mental disorders, and the phenomenon of NSIB itself should be considered rather as a nosologically nonspecific psychopathological phenomenon."

        "abstract": "Various studies have indicated that the prevalence of depression is almost twice as high among women as among men. A major factor associated with the development of depression and other affective disorders are adverse and psychologically traumatic life events that contribute to changes in the neuroendocrine system, altering the capacity to adapt to stress. These changes are involved in the pathogenesis of mental disorders, along with genetic and other factors, and are to a significant degree regulated by gender dependent mechanisms. While women have a high prevalence of depressive disorders, men show a higher rate of alcohol and substance abuse. These differences in the epidemiology are most likely explained by different predisposition to mental disorders in men and women and a diversity of biological consequences to adverse life events. Taking this into account, there is a need for a critical review of currently used approaches to modeling depressive disorders in preclinical studies, including the use of animals of both sexes. Adaptation of experimental models and protocols taking into account gender characteristics of neuroendocrine changes in response to stress, as well as structural-morphological, electrophysiological, molecular, genetic and epigenetic features, will significantly increase the translational validity of experimental work."

A comparison group consisted of 44 patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 who received physiotherapeutic treatment as a combination of transcranial magnetic therapy and electro-stimulation with simultaneous action on both brain hemispheres. Treatment duration was 10 sessions. Treatment efficacy was assessed by the decrease in frequency and intensity of complaints, improvement of patient's health status measured (a scale for assessment of activity, health perception and mood) and improvement of the status of the autonomic nervous system (Vein's questionnaire), mental sphere (the Luscher color test) and cognitive traits (The Concentrated Attention Test of the Toulouse-Pierron Factorial Battery). The status of the autonomic nervous system was evaluated before and after the treatment using cardiointervalography. Brain bioelectrical activity was assessed using encephalography.

In this Review, we discuss how urbanicity and risk of CMDs relate to each other and call for a complexity science approach to advance understanding of this interrelationship. We did an ecological analysis using data on urbanicity and CMD burden in 191 countries. We found a positive, non-linear relationship with a higher CMD prevalence in more urbanised countries, particularly for anxiety disorders. We also did a review of meta-analytic studies on the association between urban factors and CMD risk. We identified factors relating to the ambient, physical, and social urban environment and showed differences per diagnosis of CMDs. We argue that factors in the urban environment are likely to operate as a complex system and interact with each other and with individual city inhabitants (including their psychological and neurobiological characteristics) to shape mental health in an urban context. These interactions operate on various timescales and show feedback loop mechanisms, rendering system behaviour characterised by non-linearity that is hard to predict over time. We present a conceptual framework for future urban mental health research that uses a complexity science approach. We conclude by discussing how complexity science methodology (eg, network analyses, system-dynamic modelling, and agent-based modelling) could enable identification of actionable targets for treatment and policy, aimed at decreasing CMD burdens in an urban context."

In 19 patients, this period was characterized by a triad of mental disorders including cognitive dysfunction, affective disturbances and alcohol anosognosia. Memantine was recommended for all patients with mental disorders. These disorders are reduced during 11-28 (in average - 18+/-4) days after the recovery of psychosis. The hypothesis on the close relationship of three types of described disorsers with mild forms of Korsakoff disease and the expediency of memantine therapy after the delirium tremens was expressed."

A prospective study on the neuropsychic development of children from a high risk group has made it possible to identify specific deviations in the formation of mental and motor functions, as well as in the formation of behavioural reactions, contacts, and speech. Following specific disontogenesis some children developed psychopathological phenomena which may be considered as an onset of mental diseases at the given age. Further follow-up of this group of children will make it possible to differentiate symptoms of the disease from developmental deviations. At the present stage of the investigation it is difficult to answer the question whether the detected neuropsychic disintegration in the first years of life is only an indicator of subsequent schizophrenia."

The average age of patients was 57,0 ± 6,8 years. All patients were diagnosed with psychoorganic syndrome, caused by combination of different factors, which led to early cerebrovascular pathology, which was confirmed by clinical, neuropsychological, and instrumental examination. Anamnesis and the level of social adaptation were also assayed. Clinical estimation was done with the use of specially developed Clinical Psychopathological Chart. All the symptoms were divided into 4 groups (asthenic, psychovegetative, dysthymic, and cognitive symptom-complexes). No pronounced signs of dementia were observed. The control group included 44 clean-up workers without mental disorders. Predomination of various exogenous factors before and after accident was noted. Therapy included different vasotropic remedies, as well as family therapy, art therapy, and cognitive training. The possibilities of the reverse development of symptoms were statistically proved. The results allow making a conclusion that these disorders could not be explained either by radiation effects or by PTSD but connected with cerebrovascular pathology."

Changes in power of 5 EEG frequency bands in 16 records during serial mental arithmetic tasks were analyzed. Abnormalities in EEG reactivity were found both in patients and their relatives. Both groups were characterized by diffuse elevation of delta-rhythm power, the signs of hypoactivation and inversion of reaction asymmetry for different rhythm bands in the frontal area. In relatives, more pronounced attention dysfunction corresponded to more expressed abnormalities in EEG reactivity. Moreover, patients demonstrated insufficient depression of alpha and fast waves activity in the posterior cortex areas relevant to arithmetic activity. The results obtained allow considering an impaired reaction of alpha and fast rhythms inhibition in the posterior cortex areas as characteristic of the disease, and diffuse elevation of delta-waves power and frontal lobe hypoactivation with the inversion of reaction asymmetry as familial features that might reflect an impact of the factors predisposing to psychosis. This predisposition emerged during the cognitive task involving sustained attention and working memory."

Social distancing by HP is an integral part of stigmatization, which differs between various mental disorders, as well as between psychiatrists (PSY) versus nonpsychiatrist healthcare professionals (NPHP). The study included 141 HP: PSY (n=20; 36.2±4.2 y.o.) and NPHP (n=121; 25.9±2.2 y.o.). The NPHP group included general practitioners (GP)/physicians (n=29; 20.6%), surgeons (n=19; 13.5%), obstetrician-gynecologists (n=26; 18.4%), neurologists (n=11; 7.8%), pediatricians (n=6; 4.3%), and other subspecialists (including urologists, tuberculosis specialists, ophthalmologists and dermatologists) (n=30; 21.3%). The modified Bogardus Social Distance Self-Assessment Scale (BSDS) was used to evaluate the indicators of social distance phenomena. The assessment was performed by HP for the following groups of patients with the following mental disorders: alcohol use disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, drug addiction, epilepsy, mental retardation, personality disorder, schizophrenia. All statistical calculations were performed using IBM SPSS-27 software (IBM Corp. 2021, licensed to Samara State Medical University). P-value ≤0.05 was determined as significant for the between-group (PSY vs NPHP) comparisons using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test. Our data analysis showed that HP achieved varying social distance scores for patients depending on the type of mental disorder, but with common trends among PSY and NPHPs. The mean (SD) scores of social distance ranged from 3.65(1.50) for depression to 5.25 (1.74) for drug addiction in the PSY, versus 3.44 (1.69), 6.19 (1.37) in NPHP, respectively. As compared to PSY, mean BSDS total scores were greater in the NPHP group, notably in the obstetricians-gynecologist - 6.27(1.40), and GP - 6.62 (0.90) groups, with similar trends of differing attitudes appeared among pediatricians - 7.00 (0.01) - regarding drug addiction, whereas the neurologists demonstrated a tendency towards lower social distance in relation to patients with depression - 2.27 (1.68), and epilepsy - 2.82 (1.47). Social distance measures by PSY and NPHP groups in contemporary Russia were highest in relation to patients with drug addiction, and lowest scores for depression and epilepsy. Stigmatization among HPs seems to influence health care delivery to certain categories of patients, which calls for further investigation. Higher social distance scores for patients with drug addiction might be related to higher stigma and lack of compassion toward these patients. Conversely, lower scores of social distance and corresponding emotional acceptance of people with depression by HP might interfere in the timely diagnosis and availability of appropriate care at an early stage amenable to treatment. This might reflect the cultural context of depressive mentality in Russia, or elevated prevalence of depressive states among HP. We propose interventions aiming to destigmatize mental disorders by targeting particular subgroups of vulnerable patients and also certain representatives of HP community."

Along with this, the individual forms of a response to disease detection were determined. They were manifested by a number of symptom complexes: hypochondriac (13.6%), anxiety-depressive (18.4%) and paranoid (9.1%). These mental disorders gravely affected the patients and made treatment of the basic disease more complicated.

The revealed mental disorders on different stages of poisoning were less differentiated in the acute period (clouded consciousness, coma) and most diverse in pre- and postcomatose stages, where they were characterized by disturbed consciousness, hallucinatory and delusional experiences, epileptiformal syndromes, emotional, motor and other disturbances. The symptomatology depended upon the type of medical drug, intensity of medical procedures, the mental or boderline disease itself which influences the clinical picture of every stage of the intoxication."

When children had psychological pathology, the mothers' alcoholism was distinguished by greater severity of biological manifestations and relatively easier social sequelae. A peculiar nature of the alcoholism course, along with the alcohol doses taken by the mothers during pregnancy, determined the birth of children with the syndrome of alcoholic embryopathy. The appearance of children with neurotic and psychopathic disturbances reflects the polymorphism of the psychogenic effect of maternal alcoholism. A multifactorial effect of the mother's alcoholism on her progeny is postulated and practical recommendations based on this postulation are offered."

A survey was conducted using the most common scales and a cohort methodology: migrant workers (main group) and citizens of the Russian Federation residing in the Moscow region (control group) who sought outpatient medical care. The random sample included 120 migrant workers and 120 citizens of the Russian Federation aged 18 to 65, mostly males in both cohorts, with a mean age of 27±8.66 years. High anxiety was identified in respondents in both groups. Non-Russian citizen patients had a higher prevalence of depressive states (<i>p</i><0.05). Also, in the main group, the scores for insomnia severity were higher (<i>p</i><0.05). In addition, difficulties in information perception were identified in survey participants, even without a language barrier. The implementation of measures to protect the mental health of migrant workers is necessary and should include both prevention and adaptation of the healthcare system to new demands."

In the subacute period of the illness, the premorbid characteristics and psychotraumatic factors preceding the disease exert a noticeable effect on the development of depressive and ++astheno-hypochondriac disorders. In the clinical picture of acute myocardial infarction, a less significant role is played by age-associated factor. At the outpatient stage of myocardial infarction treatment, the psychotraumatic factors due to chronic disease and related situations assume a particular significance in the formation of depressive hypochondriac symptomatology."

The study suggest that visceral neuroses represent a group of independent diseases. In contrast to converse neuroses, a topical projection (respiratory, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, etc.) of visceral neuroses reflects not only a psychosomatic disorder's specificity but also the course and prognosis regularities inherent to them. HVS course is wavy with periodic exacerbations and incomplete remissions, DCS one is phased (remissive), IBS is chronic without distinct phases and intervals. HVS and DCS are comorbid to milder psychic (personality and anxiety phobic disorders) and somatic pathology. IBS is associated with not only more severe mental disorders (overvalued, hypochondriac, affective) but also with chronic somatic diseases (alimentary system)."

In the brain of embryos from normal females these cells had mainly a round or oval form (globose microglia). Axons were encountered relatively rarely. Some of the cells had protrusions of the pseudopodia-like type. In the brain of embryos from mentally ill females the cells of the microglia type have diverse, sometimes sticklike forms; they form multiple thin axons, actively fagocyte. The ultrastructure in such conditions was not destructed. These changes are considered to be the result of an increased activity of microglial cells under the influence of factors of the pathological process."

Theoretically, it could be of special interest in psychopathological cases associated with thinking disorders, as well as \"compensate\" for the tendency toward TAT aging. Using VPT 19 probands with little progressive neurosis-like schizophrenia and 19 probands with lingering neuroses were examined. The findings were estimated polyfactorially in terms of the main assumptions of TAT interpretation but with a mandatory inclusion into the analysis of the lexico-grammatical evaluation of the stories. It has been established in the course of the work that the leading differences in the delimiting of neuroses and little progressive neurosis-like schizophrenia are emotional disorders (their character and intensity) diagnosed, equally to certain thinking disorders, with the aid of the new method. It has been also shown that the new VPT is fit for analysis of the speech of the persons suffering from various mental disorders."

In addition, the change in the values of the SCL-90 parameters was assessed depending on the existence of respondent's acquaintances infected with the coronavirus. It was shown that SCL-90 symptoms (Somatization, Depression, Obsession, all integral parameters, including the Global Severity Index) increased from 22.03.20 to 22.06.20. With infected people appearing in the respondent's environment psychopathological symptoms increase. The growth of hostility, sensitivity and anxiety is associated with a personal experience of a danger of the pandemic, which intensifies when infected persons appear in the immediate environment. The increase in psychopathological symptoms after the mitigation or cancellation of the quarantine restrictions suggests the persistence of long-term consequences."

Mental health problems in people with FM have been reported in many studies. People with mental disorders are thought to be at higher risk of FM than the general population, but the prevalence has not been established. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of FM in a representative sample of inpatients with non-psychotic mental disorders. Additionally, we aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool (FiRST) in the Russian-speaking population of people with mental disorders. Consecutive inpatients admitted to the Moscow Research and Clinical Center for Neuropsychiatry for treatment of non-psychotic mental disorders were evaluated for FM by a neurologist and completed the FiRST, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Of the 1168 patients evaluated 9.0% met the diagnostic criteria for FM. FM was associated with being female, having a diagnosis of unipolar depression, and having higher total scores on the BDI and STAI. The psychometric properties of the FiRST were good (McDonald's omega 0.79, corrected item-total correlation greater than 0.45). An optimal cut-off point with the highest Yuden's index (J = 0.75) was >3 (AUC of 0.89). FM is a common comorbidity in people with non-psychotic mental disorders, associated with being female, having a diagnosis of unipolar depression, and having more severe anxiety and depression. The FiRST can be used for the FM screening with its cut-off >3 in people with non-psychotic mental disorders. It is the first study to determine the prevalence of FM in people with non-psychotic spectrum mental disorders. The study design included a consecutive sample in a real-life setting to avoid bias. In addition, we evaluated the psychometric properties of the FM screening instrument in a population of people with mental disorders and established the cut-off. The specificity of this subpopulation is explained by both the high prevalence of pain symptoms and the overlap of some psychiatric and FM symptoms."

Aneuploidy is one of the most important biological markers of genomic instability. The currently available methods of molecular cytogenetics (I-mFISH, QFISH, and ICS-MCB) facilitate the solution of numerous fundamental biological problems, including analysis ofgenomic variations in brain cells. Using these methods, we have studied for the first time aneuploidy in human embryo and adult brain cells (normal and with AT, AD, and SZ) as well as in blood cells of children with autism. The level of aneuploidy was increased two- to threefold in the embryo brain with a subsequent reduction of the number of abnormal cells in the adult brain. In the case of SZ, mosaic aneuploidy for chromosomes 1, 18, and X was found. The study of blood cells from children with autism showed chromosomal mosaicism for chromosomes X, 9, and 15. In the case of AT, we observed a global expression of aneuploidy in up to 20-50% of cortex and cerebellum neurons. In addition, a local instability of chromosome 14 was revealed in the degenerating cerebellum in the form of breaks in the 14q12 region. In the case of AD, a tenfold increase was observed in the level ofaneuploidy for chromosome 21 in brain sections subjected to neurodegeneration. These data indicate that mosaic genomic instability in nerve cells is one of the mechanism of neurodegenerative and mental diseases."

Diminished intellect in the considered mental diseases is attended by corresponding disorders in form description. Non-uniform development of intellect is associated with non-uniform development of descriptive skills.

LCM was administered as a part of polytherapy for 80 patients at a dose of up to 400 mg/day and of monotherapy for 11 patients at a dose of up to 600 mg/day for up to 12 months. Clinical-psychopathological and experimental-psychological monitoring of patients' condition over time was carried out using the Mental Health Comprehensive Assessment Scale (MHCAS), the Global Clinical Impression scale (GCI). As a result, the majority of patients (58 people (63.7%)) achieved remission with good tolerability and positive changes in cognitive functions and emotional-volitional characteristics, confirming their stability after 1 year of LCM administration."

        "abstract": "The discovery in 2001 of a G protein-coupled receptor family, subsequently termed trace amine-associated receptors (TAAR), triggered a resurgence of interest in so-called trace amines. Initial optimism quickly faded, however, as the TAAR family presented a series of challenges preventing the use of standard medicinal chemistry and pharmacology technologies. Consequently the development of basic tools for probing TAAR and translating findings from model systems to humans has been problematic. Despite these challenges the last 5years have seen considerable advances, in particular with respect to TAAR1, which appears to function as an endogenous rheostat, maintaining central neurotransmission within defined physiological limits, in part through receptor heterodimerization yielding biased signaling outputs. Regulation of the dopaminergic system is particularly well understood and clinical testing of TAAR1 directed ligands for schizophrenia and psychiatric disorders have begun. In addition, pre-clinical animal models have identified TAAR1 as a novel target for drug addiction and metabolic disorders. Growing evidence also suggests a role for TAARs in regulating immune function. This review critically discusses the current state of TAAR research, highlighting recent developments and focussing on human TAARs, their functions, and clinical implications. Current gaps in knowledge are identified, along with the research reagents and translational tools still required for continued advancement of the field. Through this, a picture emerges of an exciting field on the cusp of significant developments, with the potential to identify new therapeutic leads for some of the major unmet medical needs in the areas of neuropsychiatry and metabolic disorders."

Clinical and epidemiological surveys of 1109 examinees aged 60 years and older residing in a limited Moscow area have yielded morbidity rates for mental disease and disorders (including those by sex and age) in the population. Diagnoses was rated according to the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10). Varying mental disorders and nosological entities (without taking into account abnormalities) were found in 36.6% of examinees, including 6.1% with psychotic states, i.e. proper psychoses and clinical mental deficiency. Comparison of the results of two studies. One study was carried out in the 1980s and the present one performed 10 years later, that is, within the period of socioeconomic changes in the country, is indicative of a considerable growth of the morbidity rates in nonpsychotic forms of psychopathology of cerebrovascular genesis and psychogenic affective disorders among the Moscow elderly population. A correlation between the incidence of psychic pathology at an elderly age and different socioenvironmental factors has been studied. There are significant differences in accumulation of stress-induced life events in elderly patients with different psychopathology types. The obtained results confirm the author's assumption that the growth of psychic disorder morbidity rates, specifically, in non-psychotic forms of mental diseases of cerebrovascular genesis and psychogenic affective disorders in the past decade may be caused by increased stress-induced load on elderly people both in connection with unfavorable socioeconomic conditions of the reform epoch and a frustration of their outlook stereotypes. In the authors' opinion, their hypothesis on the correlation between the increase in the incidence of some psychogeriatric diseases and the frequency of stress-induced factors, needs further testing, in particular, by way of prospective population clinical and epidemiological studies."

It is supposed that different susceptibility genes produce distinct neurobiological and behavioural phenotypes that may each increase the risk for developing schizophrenia. The aim of the study was to search for genetically and pathophysiologically independent domains of mild cognitive disturbances that might be the components of liability to schizophrenia. One hundred and twenty-seven adult relatives of schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients were tested with a battery of cognitive tasks. Results were subjected to a principal component analysis, and factors obtained were further investigated with behavioural genetic methods in 56 families of schizophrenics. Resting EEGs were recorded from a subsample of 66 relatives. Correlations of the cognitive factors with absolute power values of seven frequency bands at 16 derivations were assessed using regression analysis. The study revealed four components of cognitive deficits in relatives of schizophrenics in domains of verbal short-term memory, thinking, communication and attention/working memory, all with substantive heritability except the last. The four components had a partial overlapping, but still distinct patterns of resting EEG correlates. The findings are in line with the assumption that cognitive deficit in high-risk individuals may be decomposed to relatively independent dimensions, each with its specific genetic and pathophysiological background."

Using clinically differentiated models (the dimensional model of schizophrenia and model of personality disorders dynamics), the arguments for the hypothesis are presented. According to this hypothesis, a dual-purpose psychopharmacotherapeutic model appears to be an optimal strategy. One of the therapeutic aims is arrest of psychosis; the other is preventing, or at least delaying, manifestation or next exacerbation of positive disorders and slowing down the disease progression in the non-psychotic stages."

Tests in an open field for all groups of animals were carried out on the 45th (first test) and 60th (second test) days after birth. The results showed that the decrease in motor activity of animals and in the number of sectors crossed in the open field with a high statistical significance was observed only in the group of animals, which for four days in the neonatal period underwent dexamethasone treatment. At the same time, another group of animals, which was also injected dexamethasone in the same doses, but additionally was injected L-arginine, the behavior in the open field did not differ from the intact animals or animals which were injected (as a control) saline solution.

        "abstract": "A test with dexamethasone was performed in 52 patients with endogenous depression, 35 chronic alcoholics, and 85 healthy individuals. In the patients with the depression the test was pathological (inhibition in 19%), and in chronic alcoholics abnormal but to a lesser degree (44%). In the healthy subjects the inhibition was 64%. In periods of remissions the test was normal in all the persons examined. A treatment with tryptophan, DOPA and phenazepam increased the degree of the inhibition. On the basis of these findings, as well as proceeding from literary data it was supposed that the disturbance of the inhibition of corticosteroid secretion by dexamethasone was due to a deficit of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, since serotonin directly stimulates the secretion of the corticotropin-releasing factor, but at the same time intensifies the inhibitory action of glucocorticoids on its secretion. These results, as well as the literary data of the existence of a genetic connection between endogenous depression and chronic alcoholism in a number of cases give one grounds to assume that in patients with endogenous depression and in a part of chronic alcoholics the predisposition to the disease is associated with some common, hereditarily-determined defects of the metabolism of biogenic amines in the brain."

The main diagnostic categories were involutional, senile and reactive psychoses, alcoholism, and schizophrenia. The main syndromes during which such acts were attempted were anxious-depressive, depressive-hypochondriacal and depressive-delusional. The formation of suicidal tendency was precipitated by age involution, somatical disorders, psychogenic traumas. In most of the patients following the suicidal attempt, there were mental disorders, conditioned both by the main psychic disturbance and by the personality reaction to the suicidal act, due to which special psychiatric treatment was necessary."

A complex of clinical-psychopathological, psychometric, psychodiagnostic and statistical methods were used. It was found that the group of IDPs is heterogeneous and includes 3 categories of persons: group I - IDPs without signs of mental disorders (conditionally healthy) (53,86%), group II - IDPs with individual symptoms of mental disorders (risk group) (20,05%) and group III - IDPs with established mental disorders (26,09%). The examined IDPs of the III group were found mental disorders, predominantly of the anxiety-depressive spectrum. Factors of psychic traumatization (FPT) were assessed in a dynamic aspect: retrospectively (during of staying in the anti-terrorist operation (ATO) zone), 12 and 24 months after leaving the ATO zone and during of examination. The dynamics of FPT and their significance in time and with regard to gender specificity were shown. In order to timely identify and prevent the formation of mental disorders in IDPs and increase their adaptive capabilities, it is proposed to use PP, which had a group structured work format. The results of its approbation were presented and it were proved that the using of PP could significantly increase the level of psychological adaptation of IDPs by reducing the level of mental stress, reactive anxiety and the severity of negative perception of the future and improving the quality of life."

Algesic phenomena were estimated according to \"Algesic anamnesis of life\" questionnaire; depression level was estimated according to Back's and Hamilton's Rating tests; the level of reactive and personality anxiety--according to Spilberger's inventory test. Severity of psychopathologic syndromes was estimated according to SCL Rating Scale. It was demonstrated that patients with CA and PD have a more significant role of depression in course of the disease as compared with anxiety; prevalence of functional-neurological symptoms in clinical pattern of PD (atypicalness); high level of somatization and a lot of algesic stresses in their life. Factors that prevent chronization of the ache were the following ones: degree of manifestation and the significance of phobic anxiety in the course of the disease, restricting behavior, atypical PD and less number of pain episodes in life."

The mediating processes remain poorly understood, but three factors show some promise: adolescent externalizing traits, early life adversity, and midbrain dopamine autoreceptors. To investigate whether these features acquire greater predictive power when combined, a longitudinal study was conducted in youth who have been followed since birth. Cohort members were invited to participate based on externalizing scores between 11 to 16 years of age. At age 18 (age 18.5 ± 0.6 y.o.), 52 entry criteria meeting volunteers had a 90-min positron emission tomography scan with [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride, completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5. The three-factor model identified those with a lifetime history of DSM-5 disorders with an overall accuracy of 90.4% (p = 2.4 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) and explained 91.5% of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [95% CI: .824, 1.000]. Targeting externalizing disorders specifically did not yield a more powerful model than targeting all disorders (p = 0.54). The model remained significant when including data from participants who developed their first disorders during a three-year follow-up period (p = 3.5 × 10<sup>-5</sup>). Together, these results raise the possibility that a combination of temperamental traits, childhood adversity, and poorly regulated dopamine transmission increases risk for diverse, commonly comorbid, early onset psychiatric problems, predicting this susceptibility prospectively."

The recent identification of a trace amine-sensitive G protein-coupled receptor, trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), and subsequent development of TAAR1-selective small-molecule ligands, has renewed research into the therapeutic possibilities of trace amine signaling. Areas covered: Recent efforts in elucidating the neuropharmacology of TAAR1, particularly in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease, addiction, and regulation of arousal state, will be discussed. Focused application of TAAR1 mutants, synthetic TAAR1 ligands, and endogenous biomolecules such as 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM) has yielded a basic functional portrait for TAAR1, despite a complex biochemistry and pharmacology. The close functional relationship between TAAR1 and dopaminergic signaling is likely to underlie many of its CNS effects. However, TAAR1's influences on serotonin and glutamate neurotransmission will also be highlighted. Expert opinion: TAAR1 holds great promise as a therapeutic target for mental illness, addiction, and sleep disorders. A combination of preclinical and translationally driven studies has solidified TAAR1 as a key node in the regulation of dopaminergic signaling. Continued focus on the mechanisms underlying TAAR1's regulation of serotonin and glutamate signaling, as well as dopamine, will yield further disease-relevant insights."

The prevalence of CGP in these countries is 10.7-13.2%. The etiology of CGP is unclear; however, several findings suggest that this is a process of somatization that masks affective disorders. There have been no studies of the epidemiology of CGP in Russia. The study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of CGP in the Yekaterinburg adult population and to examine the relationship of CGP to its demographic characteristics and affective disorders. A ostal cross-sectional population survey was conducted. This covered 159 persons (54 males and 105 females) aged 27 to 75 years who had been randomly selected from the election lists of Yekaterinburg residents. A questionnaire was posted to each participant in order to reveal whether a respondent had experienced pain a month before, to define its location, duration, severity, and to evaluate psychoemotional disorders. The response rate was 75.5% (120 replies). The prevalence of CGP was 13.3%. There was no relationship of the sex of a respondent to CGP. The latter was shown to be associated with age. There was also its significant association with psychoemotional disorders. CGP is a common condition in the Yekateringburg population, which occurs in every 8 adult residents, more frequently in those aged above 43 years.

        "abstract": "The need to use large samples to identify the genetic risk loci of mental disorders has led us to the dilemma of phenotyping quality. Especially this problem relates to such common mental disorders as depression (lifetime prevalence 16.2%). On the one hand, there is a very resource-intensive method of capturing patient data by physicians using diagnostic criteria of mental disorders (DSM-V/ICD-10). On the other, there is a popular method of minimal phenotyping using hospital registers, self-reports of respondents on symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of depression. To date, there is no ideal method for phenotyping depression because all of them focus only on its clinical symptoms. The active usage of minimal phenotyping in Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) has led to a significant increase in both clinical and genetic heterogeneity of depression. However, an important limitation of using DSM-V/ICD-10 is the high cost of phenotyping due to the involvement of medical specialists. Thus, the most rational is to use electronic diagnostic questionnaires based on DSM-V/ICD-10 criteria. Such an approach will accelerate the increase in research capacity, but will preserve all internal contradictions inherent in official diagnostic classifications (heterogeneity of phenotypes, absence of objective diagnostic criteria, categorical approach, etc.). In this regard, the critical role of psychiatric epidemiology is growing both in the development of standardized tools for operationalized diagnostic criteria and in future GWAS by introducing new phenotypic subtypes of depression and its dimensions."

With the goal of early recognition, primary care physicians (PCPs) play a significant role in the detection and referral of mental disorders. However, PCPs report several barriers related to confidence, knowledge, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Therefore, initiatives have been taken to assist PCPs in their clinical decision-making through clinical decision support methods (CDSMs). This review aimed to identify CDSMs in the literature and describe their functionalities and quality. In this review, a search strategy was performed to access all available studies in PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, Web of Science, and COCHRANE using keywords. Studies that involved CDSMs for PCP clinical decision-making regarding psychosocial or psychiatric problems among children and youths (0-24 years old) were included. The search was conducted according to PRISMA-Protocols. Of 1,294 studies identified, 25 were eligible for inclusion and varied in quality. Eighteen CDSMs were described. Fourteen studies described computer-based methods with decision support, focusing on self-help, probable diagnosis, and treatment suggestions. Nine studies described telecommunication methods, which offered support through interdisciplinary (video) calls. Two studies described CDSMs with a combination of components related to the two CDSM categories. Easy-to-use CDSMs of good quality are valuable for advising PCPs on the detection and referral of children and youths with mental health disorders.

Binding with the target RNA, a miRNA can supress translation and/or induce degradation of mRNA. The studies of miRNAs have already shown that miRNA were essential to switch the programs of gene expression during embryo development as well as to control cell functioning of the adult organism. Alteration of the miRNA expression profile may appear not less important in development of pathology than better known structural variations of the proteins. The role of miRNA has been confirmed for a range of common diseases connected to impaired balance of cell proliferation, differentiation and programmed death. This review discusses specific features of miRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression and its role in normal and pathological development of muscle, immune, and nervous systems. The evidence of miRNA involvent in neurodegenerative disorders and mental disorders is demonstrated."

All patients underwent a clinical psychiatric interview based on ICD-10 criteria. The Mini-Mental State Examination scale and Hypomania-Checklist (HCL-32) were used. Mental disorders were diagnosed in 79.1% of patients. Organic spectrum disorders were found in 46.1%, bipolar spectrum disorders in 35.7%, schizophrenia spectrum disorders in 4.3%. The patients with bipolar spectrum disorders had significantly lower serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels compared to patients with organic spectrum disorders (p=0.01). The presence of organic spectrum disorders was associated with older age and number of somatic comorbidities (р=0.0001 and 0.001).

Allele and genotype frequencies have been estimated in 3 groups, aged 60-69, 70-79 and 80-87 years, respectively. A trend (chi2=4.1; p=0.12) to the prevalence of individuals with SS genotype (21.8%), as compared to expected level (14.6%), was found in the group of octogenarians (n=55, mean age 82.8+/-1.9 years). An association analysis between genotype and physiological traits revealed a genotype contribution to past smoking on tendency level (p=0.069), waist to hip ratio (WHR) (p=0.012) and plasma insulin concentration (p=0.02), with a higher frequency of SS genotype among non-smokers and subjects with lower WHR and insulin concentration.

We then explored biological functions of the top pleiotropic genes. A total of 243 cross-trait genes were identified for the seven traits. Except for autism spectrum disorder, there was significant enrichment of overlapped genes across these psychiatric traits. Chromosome 5q14.3, 11q23.2, and 7p22.3 are the three genomic regions conferring highest pleiotropic effects for these psychiatric traits. The long non-coding gene LINC00461 showed the highest pleiotropic effects on five psychiatric traits.

This inconsistency complicates the diagnosis of anxiety and depressive disorders in clinical practice, in particular in elderly patients. We attempted to study the nosological structure of anxiety states in elderly patients and work out recommendations on differential diagnosis of anxiety disorders and depressions. A main group included 80 elderly patients with anxiety disorders, 80 patients with anxious depression were enrolled in comparison group. These groups were selected on the basis of the primary diagnosis made before enrollment patients into the study. After the detailed examination of patients with anxiety disorders, the diagnosis has been changed in 67.5% of patients. Symptoms of all patients with hypochondriac, somatisized and somatoform pain disorders were corresponded to atypical anxious depression. Duration and severity of psychogenic disorders of adaptation and acute reactions to stress were also corresponded to the diagnosis of depression. All patients with obsessive-compulsive disorders had typical symptoms of neurosis-like schizophrenia, these patients were excluded from the study. After the revision of diagnoses, the group with anxiety disorders comprised 26 patients and the group with depression increased up to 131 patients. A between-group comparison of clinical/anamnesis data showed that mean age of patients with depression (59.7 years) was significantly higher than that of patients with anxiety disorders (56 years). Levels of anxiety measured with the Hamilton scale (HAM-A) were similar in both groups. MADRS scores were significantly higher in the depression group (27.9) compared to patients with anxiety disorders (16.5). The most frequent diagnoses that mask depression in elderly people are hypochondriac, somatisized and somatoform pain disorders as well as acute reactions to stress and disorders of adaptation. Somatoform autonomic dysfunction and agoraphobia are less frequent diagnoses. Clinical-psychopathological examination of elderly patients with these disorders requires a careful search for symptoms of a possible atypical depression.

One of the approaches to the selection of adequate psychopharmacotherapy may be the concept of comorbidity of disturbances, determining the structure of the syndrome and perspectives of its impact. With this in view, the structure of some syndromes may be considered not as a complex of closely interrelated disturbances, but as states stemming from relatively independent pathological disturbances, connected by probable relations. The problem of differentiated psychopharmacotherapy in line with the phenomenon of comorbidity at the level of symptom-syndrome, psychopathological personality disturbances (including negative ones), may have a practical as well as a theoretical significance. An analysis of comorbid connections determines as well the selection of preventive drugs in the prophylaxis of relapses of psychoses. An eventual study of all sides of this problem has its goal to define the spectre of action of the already known drugs and new psychopharmacological preparations, a deeper understanding of psychopathology and the clinical state being under the impact of psychopharmacological therapy, a transition from an extensive understanding of a wide range of questions of psychopharmacology to an intensive study of separate facets of the problem, which seems to be most perspective."

The present experiments investigated whether BDNF ameliorates the damaging effect of prenatal ethanol and stress exposure on behavior in offspring. Prenatal exposure of ethanol and stress combined during gestation inverted sexual partner preference of male offspring, increased social contacts with juvenile male mouse and stereotypic burying activity in the marble-burying test suggesting predisposition to homosexuality and to obsessive-compulsive disorder. Centrally administered BDNF (300ng i.c.v.) restored sexual female preference of male adult offspring and decreased marble-burying activity. Ameliorative effect was shown in 7-10 days after BDNF administration. The results provide the first evidence that BDNF improves epigenetic impairment of behavior and may have profound implications in the treatment of neurologic disorders induced by early environmental challenges."

        "abstract": "Adolescent delinquency and alcohol abuse have become a growing concern in Russia. Psychopathology, a dysfunctional family and specific personality factors have all been linked to addictive and antisocial behavior. Since delinquent youth represent a specific risk group, where alcohol misuse tends to be more pronounced than in the general population, the objectives of this study were: 1) to compare differences in personality and parenting factors, and in psychopathology in juvenile delinquents with and without alcohol abuse; and 2) to evaluate the associations between alcohol abuse, personality and parenting factors, after controlling for comorbid psychopathology. Psychopathology, including alcohol abuse, was assessed by means of a psychiatric interview in 229 Russian incarcerated male juvenile delinquents. In addition, alcohol use, personality, and parenting factors were assessed by self-reports. Alcohol-abusing delinquents (n=138) scored significantly higher on novelty seeking and maternal emotional warmth and reported higher levels of psychopathology, as compared to nonalcohol-abusing delinquents (n=91). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that personality and parenting factors were significantly related to alcohol abuse, even after controlling for comorbid psychopathology. Alcohol-abusing delinquents are at risk for a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders. Alcohol abuse is associated with personality and parenting factors independently of comorbid psychopathology. Early interventions with high-risk youths may help to reduce their psychiatric problems and alcohol abuse."

Such infarctions resulted in acute development of mental disorders which corresponded to dementia in 7 cases and to slight cognitive disorders in 2 cases. The complex of mental disorders resembled one in \"Frontal Syndrome\" and was characterised mainly by aspontaneity, adynamia, hypersomnia, disorientation, memory impairment, attention deficit, delay of all mental processes, lack of criticism and adequacy. Accompanying focal neurologic symptoms were slight in 7 patients, moderate or pronounced in 2 cases. In 5 patients the manifestation of mental disorders decreased gradually. Computer tomography revealed small infarctions in anterior or medial areas of T in 7 cases, and in thalamofrontal routes in 2 patients. Infarctions were located in dominant hemisphere of brain in 5 patients, in nondominant one--in 3 cases, in both hemispheres--in one patient. Location of all the foci corresponded to the structures through which the routes passed and connected T and reticular formation localized lower with frontal lobes of brain. It was suggested that separation of these routes resulted in cognitive disorders or dementia because of functional inactivation of the cortex of frontal lobes of brain."

A consensus panel of 34 international experts representing 22 countries developed recommendations based on efficacy and acceptability of the treatments. In this version, not only medications but also psychotherapies and other non-pharmacological interventions were evaluated, applying the same rigorous methods that are standard for the assessment of medication treatments. The present paper (Part II) contains recommendations based on published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the treatment of OCD (<i>n</i> = 291) and PTSD (<i>n</i> = 234) in children, adolescents, and adults. The accompanying paper (Part I) contains the recommendations for the treatment of anxiety disorders.For OCD, first-line treatments are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Internet-CBT was also superior to active controls. Several second-line medications are available, including clomipramine. For treatment-resistant cases, several options are available, including augmentation of SSRI treatment with antipsychotics and other drugs.Other non-pharmacological treatments, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), deep brain stimulation (DBS) and others were also evaluated.For PTSD, SSRIs and the SNRI venlafaxine are first-line treatments. CBT is the psychotherapy modality with the best body of evidence. For treatment-unresponsive patients, augmentation of SSRI treatment with antipsychotics may be an option. OCD and PTSD can be effectively treated with CBT and medications."

Implementation of these principles requires a two-stage qualification. The first stage should be narrative detailed syndromological qualifications with identification of psychotic level of disorders. As for the second stage, the qualification should be nosological, based on complete clinical analysis, which is far from being possible to realize at once. ICD-10, specifically brought to nosological certainty, may remain the natural foundation for nosological qualification. Implementation of the syndromic qualification at the first stage will allow to consider nosological features of each syndrome at the second stage and to expand the list of criteria in different clusters. Such a suggestion opens the prospect for subsequent revisions of the ICD and allows to direct our efforts and those of practitioners to the unified channel, where the statistical goals would not be implemented at the expense of the research ones."

        "abstract": "Exposure to stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and leads to increased levels of glucocorticoid (GC) hormones. Prolonged elevation of GC levels causes neuronal dysfunction, decreases the density of synapses, and impairs neuronal plasticity. Decreased sensitivity to glucocorticoids (glucocorticoid resistance) that develops as a result of chronic stress is one of the characteristic features of stress-induced psychopathologies. In this article, we reviewed the published data on proposed molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development of glucocorticoid resistance in brain, including changes in the expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene, biosynthesis of GR isoforms, and GR posttranslational modifications. We also present data on alterations in the expression of the FKBP5 gene encoding the main component of cell ultra-short negative feedback loop of GC signaling regulation. Recent discoveries on stress- and GR-induced changes in epigenetic modification patterns as well as normalizing action of antidepressants are discussed. GR and FKBP5 gene polymorphisms associated with stress-induced psychopathologies are described, and their role in glucocorticoid resistance is discussed."

We herein describe a study design protocol for recognizing neuropsychiatric complications associated with pediatric COVID-19, and for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies grounded on the evidence-based findings. The study includes two cohorts, each with 163 participants, aged from 7 to 18 years old, and matched by gender. One cohort consisted of individuals with a history of COVID-19, while the other group presents those without such a history. We undertake comprehensive assessments, including neuropsychiatric evaluations, blood tests, and validated questionnaires completed by parents/guardians and by the children themselves. The data analysis is based on machine learning techniques to develop predictive models for COVID-19-associated neuropsychiatric complications in children and adolescents. The first model is focused on a binary classification to distinguish participants with and without a history of COVID-19. The second model clusters significant indicators of clinical dynamics during the follow-up observation period, including the persistence of COVID-19 related somatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms over time. The third model manages the predictors of discrete trajectories in the dynamics of post-COVID-19 states, tailored for personalized prediction modeling of affective, behavioral, cognitive, disturbances (academic/school performance), and somatic symptoms of the long COVID. The current protocol outlines a comprehensive study design aiming to bring a better understanding of COVID-19-associated neuropsychiatric complications in a population of children and adolescents, and to create a mobile phone-based applications for the diagnosis and treatment of affective, cognitive, and behavioral conditions. The study will inform about the improved management of preventive and personalized care strategies for pediatric COVID-19 patients.

The disease often manifests with psychopathological symptoms and catatonia, so patients are transferred into a mental healthcare institution and often require intensive care and resuscitation, due to the development of life-threatening respiratory and hemodynamic disorders. Diagnosis is based on detection of autoantibodies to the NR1- and NR2 subunits of the glutamate NMDA receptor in blood serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Pathogenesis-based therapy includes the administration of glucocorticoids and intravenous immunoglobulins, plasmapheresis, as well as the introduction of monoclonal antibodies in also used, and in severe cases, cytostatics are prescribed. The widespread comorbidity of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis with ovarian neoplasms in women (up to 60%) requires appropriate diagnosis and early removal of ovarian neoplasms when they are detected. With timely diagnosis and adequate treatment strategies, the outcome of this rare disorder is usually positive."

The plasticity and great variety of brain functions are shown to be based on the unique diversity of genes actively transcribing in the brain and the molecular mechanisms of various genetic products of the same gene: alternative splicing, \"antiparallel\" coding, regulation of gene activity by signal DNA sequences. Gene search policies are described for common mental disorders such as schizophrenia, manic-depressive psychosis, Alzheimer's disease. The attempts to map defective genes by \"reverse\" genetics have proved that there is a genetic heterogeneity of these diseases. The novel directions in the study of the brain molecular genetic apparatus can be examinations of chromosomal behavior in the cells in various brain regions and genome imprinting."

However, little is known about the connection between ADHD/ASD and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study aimed to investigate the genetic associations between these disorders. Genetic correlation analysis was used to examine the genetic components shared between ADHD (38 691 cases and 275 986 controls), ASD (18 381 cases and 27 969 controls) and PTSD (23 212 cases and 151 447 controls). Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were employed to explore the bidirectional causal relationships between ADHD/ASD and PTSD. The results of the genetic correlation analysis revealed significant positive correlations of PTSD with ADHD(r g  = 0.70) and ASD (r g  = 0.34). Furthermore, the Mendelian randomization analysis revealed that genetic liabilities to ADHD [odds ratio (OR) = 1.14; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-1.24; P  = 7.88 × 10 -4 ] and ASD (OR = 1.04; CI, 1.01-1.08; P  = 0.014) were associated with an increased risk of developing PTSD later in life. However, no evidence supported that genetic liability to PTSD could elevate the risk of ADHD or ASD. The findings of this study supported that ADHD and ASD may increase the risk of PTSD, but not vice versa."

While rodent studies of ARBs continue to dominate the field, mounting evidence suggests that zebrafish (Danio rerio) also display ARB-like phenotypes and may therefore be a novel model organism for ARB research. In addition to clear practical research advantages as a model species, zebrafish share high genetic and physiological homology to humans and rodents, including multiple ARB-related genes and robust behaviors relevant to ARB. Here, we discuss a wide spectrum of stereotypic repetitive behaviors in zebrafish, data on their genetic and pharmacological modulation, and the overall translational relevance of fish ARBs to modeling human brain disorders. Overall, the zebrafish is rapidly emerging as a new promising model to study ARBs and their underlying mechanisms."

Peculiarities of combined pathologies were as follows: one disease (beer alcoholism) created conditions for the development of another one (hashish addiction); the polymorphism of clinical symptoms (the syndrome of addiction included symptoms of both diseases); reciprocity of these diseases. Psychosensory disorders played a central role in clinical presentations of mixed intoxication. There was the increase of tolerance to hashish while the amount of consumed beer remained stable. Symptoms characteristic of dependence of both psychoactive substances were present in the clinical presentations of the syndrome. Mental disorders (dysphoric signs) were observed more frequently in the abstinent syndrome in the combined beer and hashish reception. Personality changes in teenagers promoted criminal activity."

Intraanesthetic awakening has been established to play a leading role in the development of STPMD. Under general anesthesia, the incidence of the latter is not higher than that under regional anesthesia, although the causes of STP-MD are likely to be different in either case. And, finally, CNS function monitoring is seemingly considered to be a compulsory component of intraoperative control of a patient's condition during general anesthesia.

Interferon-alpha is one of the key polyfunctional cytokines providing integrative activity of the neuro-immuno-endocrine complex.

Mechanisms of its involvement in regulation of pain, sleep, body temperature, circadian rhythms, food consumption etc. are considered. Based on the literature and our data we hypothesized a dose-dependent action of exogenous interferon-alpha on the nervous system. We suggest that optimal schemes of chronic application of small interferon-alpha doses can be more expedient for treatment of viral or oncologic diseases than large doses causing neuropsychiatric disorders."

The systemic inflammation as well as neuroinflammatory changes are associated with massive increase of the brain pro-inflammatory molecules, neuroglial reactivity, altered neurochemical landscape and pathological remodelling of neuronal networks. These organic changes, emerging in concert with environmental stress caused by experiences of intensive therapy wards, pandemic fears and social restrictions, promote neuropsychiatric pathologies including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder (BD), various psychoses, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Twenty-seven patients (9 men and 18 women, mean age 59.8±11.9 years) with the upper and lower motor neuron lesions were studied. The average duration of the disease at the time of examination was 3.2±2.4 years. Clinical psychopathological and follow-up methods were used. The severity of cognitive impairment was measured with the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioral ALS Screen (ECAS). The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to assess the severity of depression. Most patients (88.9%) had cognitive impairments. Amnestic disorders were primarily presented by hypo- and dysmnesia. These patients showed slow thinking, torpidity combined with circumstantiality and a tendency to detail. In addition to attentional fluctuations, we observed reduced attentional capacity, higher distractibility, and difficulty concentrating. The later stages of the disease were accompanied by the overall decline of thinking ability and intelligence with severe perseverations, and failure in the adequate self-assessment. More than half of the patients also developed the symptoms, such as dynamic aphasia, as well as functional speech disorders, i.e. gnosis and praxis. The vast majority of the patients had affective disorders (92.3%). So far as the symptoms of the underlying neurological condition worsened, the associated depressive symptoms prevailed (62.9%). Particular attention should be given to the clinical cases of ALS associated with psychotic disorders such as acute schizophrenia-like psychotic disorders. Presence of affective, cognitive and behavioral disorders, as well as a specific neuroimaging pattern, are considered as a whole as the manifestation of the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This provides support for the current opinion suggesting the similarity of ALS and FTD, which allows for considering these diseases as different phenotypic manifestations of a single pathological process."

This study aims to assess the clinical validity of three frailty models among community-dwelling older adults in north-western Russia where there is a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease and lower life expectancy than in European countries. The Crystal study is a population-based prospective cohort study in Kolpino, St. Petersburg, Russia. A random sample of the population living in the district was stratified into two age groups: 65-75 (n = 305) and 75+ (n = 306) and had a baseline comprehensive health assessment followed by a second one after 33.4 +/-3 months. The total observation time was 47 +/-14.6 months. Frailty was assessed according to the models of Fried, Puts and Steverink-Slaets. Its association with mortality at 5 years follow-up as well as dependency, mental and physical decline at around 2.5 years follow up was explored by multivariable and time-to-event analyses. Mortality was predicted independently from age, sex and comorbidities only by the frail status of the Fried model in those over 75 years old [HR (95 % CI) = 2.50 (1.20-5.20)]. Mental decline was independently predicted only by pre-frail [OR (95 % CI) = 0.24 (0.10-0.55)] and frail [OR (95 % CI) = 0.196 (0.06-0.67)] status of Fried model in those 65-75 years old. The prediction of dependency and physical decline by pre-frail and frail status of any the three frailty models was not statistically significant in this cohort of older adults. None of the three frailty models was valid at predicting 5 years mortality and disability, mental and physical decline at 2.5 years in a cohort of older adults in north-west Russia. Frailty by the Fried model had only limited value for mortality in those 75 years old and mental decline in those 65-75 years old.

Despite immunotherapy, no positive changes in the immunological indices were observed in the carriers, which was attributable to decreased activity of the enzyme in the immunocompetent cells."

The children of mothers suffering from alcoholism revealed are characterized by increased risk of depression, anxiety and other mental disorders, including alcohol and substance dependence. The adverse impact of maternal alcoholism (or, to speak more widely, parents' alcoholism) on the child health requires special preventive and treatment programs for both parents and children. Separation from the mother (even if the mother is addicted to alcohol) seriously injures the child, and therefore treatment programs for alcohol abusing women should be focused on the possible continuation of the parental rights of patients."

Patients aged 18 to 59 years diagnosed with MDD, regardless of the stage (exacerbation or remission), were recruited from both outpatient and inpatient settings across seven centres in Russia. The MDD diagnosis of each patient was confirmed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Depression severity was assessed using the clinician-administered Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Disordered eating behaviours were assessed using the 26-item Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26). Severity of anhedonia was assessed using the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale. Symptoms of hypomania were identified using the Hypomania Checklist. Suicide risk was assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. State and trait anxiety levels were assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. In total, 216 women and 122 men aged 18 to 59 years with a diagnosis of MDD were included in analysis. Higher EAT-26 scores were associated with longer duration of the longest depressive episode, an earlier age of MDD onset, and a tendency towards hyperphagia during depressive episodes. EAT-26 scores were positively correlated with the Hypomania Checklist scores (ρ = 0.346, p < 0.001), the presence of suicidal ideations during the previous month (ρ = 0.146, p = 0.008), and the trait anxiety score (ρ = 0.198, p = 0.003) of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Patients with MDD who exhibited more pronounced disordered eating behaviours also had an earlier age of onset, a longer duration of the longest depressive episode, and higher Hypomania Checklist scores. These clinical markers are more characteristic of bipolar disorder, suggesting latent bipolarity or an increased risk of progression to bipolar disorder."

Fifty inpatients with IBD, including 32 with ulcerative colitis and 19 with Crohn's disease, were examined using clinical and follow-up methods. Affective mental disorders (depressions of various structures of different genesis) were found in most (72%) of cases. Adaptation disorders in patients with personality pathology, depression in cyclothymia, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia were identified as well. Psychosomatic correlations depended on the stage of IBD and the genesis of affective disorders. Somatogenic asthenic disorders prevailed at the stage of IBD manifestation and depressions of different structure with different course (recurrent, bipolar, attack-like) at the further stages of IBD. The psychosomatic relations at the subsequent stages of IBD were characterized by psychosomatic balancing. There were tendencies of convergence and divergence of mental disorders with the current somatic disease. The most severe variants (chronic continuous course, resistance to therapy) were found in patients with comorbid endogenous mental disorders. This was primarily due to the lack of a rational attitude of patients to the somatic disease and, therefore, the low compliance that must be taken into account in the treatment."

The causes of the frequent concurrence of dizziness and mental disorders (anxiety and depression) are diverse. Amongst these there are two chief conditions: 1) vestibular vertigo may cause anxiety to a greater extent than many other symptoms; 2) anxiety and depression are themselves frequently manifested by the sensations resembling vestibular ones that patients are inclined to call dizziness. On the contrary, anxiety may appear in some cases as the sensations resembling dizziness. Besides the latter, the patient may present a lot of complaints, which serves as a manifestation of psychoautonomic syndrome (the basis for which is anxiety and depression). At the same time, the term 'phobic postural instability' is proposed to describe psychogenic disorders, in which dizziness becomes virtually the only chief complaint. The treatment of dizziness and anxiety disorders in the elderly encompasses a few areas: vestibular rehabilitation, drug therapy, and psychotherapy. The paper describes the possibilities of using anvifen as a pathogenetically sound treatment in patients with anxiety disorders, as anvifen is a GABA-ergic medication."

In fishes as well as in mammals, monoamines-neurotransmitters assist in brain functioning. Norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin affect the alimentation, motion activity, aggression and social behaviour. Changes in concentration ratio of serotonin and its metabolites in invaded species were more pronounced, which pointed to directed effects of pathogens on serotonin activity. The same effect of some pathogens on human behaviour does not have selective significance because humans are not an essential link in life cycle of many parasites.

Despite the great need to protect the mental health of children and adolescents, in Russia and most countries of the world, there is a shortage of qualified personnel in this area. The article presents data on the availability of personnel in different countries of the world, including Russia. The issues of organizing the training of child and adolescent psychiatrists in Russia and various countries are examined, and the available data on training programs are analyzed. Educational opportunities for child and adolescent psychiatry in Russia are examined in detail."

A complex of unfavorable environmental factors has an adverse impact of the mental and emotional status of children who had similar social, sanitary, and history data, which makes itself evident in the fact that the girls showed worse intellectual and mnestic activities and the boys had increased anxiety. It is concluded that it is expedient to use tests for estimating the children's mental and emotional status for making a predisease diagnosis of environmentally induced conditions in the follow-up post of a local social and sanitary monitoring network."

        "abstract": "A broad spectrum of pathogenic species is able to purposefully change the behavior of mammals, intermediate hosts, thus increasing the probability for parasites to transform into a final host and preserving them as a species. For this, pathogens decrease host mobility or inhibit an avoidance reaction in a carnivore, the final host of the parasite. The found similar effects of some pathogens on human behavior are of no selective value as man is not an indispensable link in the ecological chain of parasitic development. However, such an action on behavior may result in negative consequences. For example, individuals with latent toxoplasmosis become the participants and victims of traffic road accidents significantly more frequently due to reduced capacity to attention focusing."

        "abstract": "G protein-coupled trace amine-associated receptors (TAAR) recognize different classes of amine compounds, including trace amines or other exogenous and endogenous molecules. Yet, most members of the TAAR family (TAAR2-TAAR9) are considered olfactory receptors involved in sensing innate odors. In this study, TAAR6 mRNA expression was evaluated in the brain transcriptomic datasets available in the GEO, Allen Brain Atlas, and GTEx databases. Transcriptomic data analysis demonstrated ubiquitous weak TAAR6 mRNA expression in the brain, especially in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. RNA sequencing of isolated cells from the nucleus accumbens showed that the expression of TAAR6 in some cell populations may be more pronounced than in whole-tissue samples. Curiously, in D1 and D2 dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny GABAergic neurons of the nucleus accumbens, TAAR6 expression was co-regulated with genes involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling. However, in cholinergic interneurons of the nucleus accumbens, TAAR6 expression was not associated with the activation of any specific biological process. Finally, TAAR6 expression in the mouse prefrontal cortex was validated experimentally by RT-PCR analysis. These data demonstrated that TAAR6 is expressed at low levels in the human and mouse brain, particularly in limbic structures involved in the pathogenesis of mental disorders, and thus might represent a new pharmacotherapeutic target."

        "abstract": "We examined the prevalence and spread of conspiracy beliefs about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic among representatives of the Russian population. Our study aimed to identify belief clusters and develop predictive models to understand the factors that influence conspiracy beliefs, particularly in the context of how they might evolve in response to socio-political events and cause mental disturbances, thus in relation to specific pathways of the infodemic and psychodemic waves that spread among vulnerable population groups. Data respondents to the international COMET-G study living in Russia during pandemic period (n=7,777) were analyzed using descriptive statistics, K-means clustering, and various machine learning models, including gradient boosting. We identified distinct populations depending on predominant beliefs about COVID-19 pandemic origins, and applied game theory (Shapely additive explanations) to determine the most influential variables in predicting cluster membership. Four distinct belief clusters emerged, which we designate as Naturalists, Conspiracists, COVID-Sceptics, and the Incoherent Attitude groups. The Incoherent Attitude cluster constituted 20.8% of the sample, and was particularly associated with mental health signs such as sleep disturbances and the use of psychotropic medications. Internet use and mental health-related factors, as well as the respondents' education level, were key predictors of mental disturbances with mediating effects of the conspiracy views across all clusters. Conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 origin were highly fluid/variable, often being shaped by external sociopolitical factors rather than objective health data. The cluster with Incoherent Attitude regarding COVID-pandemic origins, which had an association with psychoticism, showed a greater predisposition for mental health problems, than did the Conspiracist, Naturalist and Sceptic clusters. We suppose that underlying psychoticism bears a relation to their sleep problems and resorting to use of psychotropic medications. These results emphasizes the global health need for implementing target-focused and selective strategies that address public misinformation and promote the adoption of critical thinking skills to mitigate the impact of conspiracy theories, considering the factors of education level and pre-existing mental disorders."

The special studies demonstrated that true indicators of morbidity of adolescents exceed official indicators up to 1.5-2 times. The morbidity of adolescents is characterized by increasing of socially significant pathology and diseases related to behavioral risk factors. In adolescent age, the unfavorable tendencies in psychic and reproductive health are observed. In the structure of disability mental disorders and behavior disorders, diseases of nervous system and inherited malformations are in the lead.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the burden of psychiatric disorders in adult patients hospitalized with ß-thalassemia in the United States (US). We utilized the discharge data from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2010 through 2014 to identify hospitalized ß-thalassemia patients who are 18 years and older. We assessed categorical and continuous variables using chi-square test and Student's t test respectively. The burden of psychiatric disorders was assessed using descriptive statistics and represented in terms of frequency (n) and percentage (%). A p value threshold of < 0.05 was considered clinically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Of the 10,046 ß-thalassemia patients studied, 24.4% (n = 2448) reported psychiatric disorders. Mood disorders (15.2%; inclusive of 10.3% depression), followed by anxiety (9.4%), and substance abuse disorder (6.5%; 4.3% drug abuse, 2.2% alcohol abuse) were most prevalent. Comorbid mental illnesses increased the length of stay by 44.6% and total costs by 23.4%. All-cause mortality rate was reported at 1.9% in overall ß-thalassemia patients. This study highlights higher rates of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety and correlated increases in length of stay and cost in hospitalized ß-thalassemia patients. To improve medical outcomes and curtail unnecessary health-care costs, implementation of an integrated care model can be considered."

Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the mutual influences between COVID-19 outcomes and childhood mental disorders. We examined genetic correlations and potential causalities between three childhood mental disorders and three COVID-19 phenotypes by genetically proxied analyses. The three mental disorders included attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, N = 292,548), Tourette's syndrome (TS, N = 14,307), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, N = 46,350). The three COVID-19 traits included SARS-CoV-2 infection (N = 2,597,856), hospitalized COVID-19 (N = 2,095,324), and critical COVID-19 (N = 1,086,211). Literature-based analysis was used to build gene-based pathways connecting ADHD and COVID-19. ADHD was positively correlated with the three COVID-19 outcomes (R<sub>g</sub>: 0.22 ~ 0.30). Our Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses found that ADHD confers a causal effect on hospitalized COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR): 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.69). TS confers a causal effect on critical COVID-19 (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04-1.25). Genetic liability to the COVID-19 outcomes may not increase the risk for the childhood mental disorders. Pathway analysis identified several immunity-related genes that may link ADHD to COVID-19, including CRP, OXT, IL6, PON1, AR, TNFSF12, and IL10. Our study suggests that both ADHD and TS may augment the severity of COVID-19 through immunity-related pathways. However, our results did not support a causal role of COVID-19 in the risk for the childhood mental disorders."

It has been established that the pathological mechanisms of formation of different syndromes of mental activity reduction are naturally related to deceleration of the general and regional volumetric cerebral blood flow (RVCBF) and a decrease of the general and regional reaction of cerebral vessels (RCV). In this respect, the character of the psychopathological syndrome is specified by localization (lobar and interhemispheric) of the primary deceleration of the RVCBF and RCV decrease; by the rate of augmentation of those changes, their intensity and duration, constancy or periodicity; background against which there develops the hypoxic process; as well as by the development of the underlying disease."

Nowadays, the role of OXT and AVP in the regulation of social behaviour and emotions is generally known. However, recent researches indicate that peptides also participate in cognitive functioning. This review presents the evidence that the OXT/AVP systems are involved in the formation of social, working, spatial and episodic memory, mediated by such brain structures as the hippocampal CA2 and CA3 regions, amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Some data have demonstrated that the OXT receptor's polymorphisms are associated with impaired memory in humans, and OXT knockout in mice is connected with memory deficit. Additionally, OXT and AVP are involved in mental disorders' progression. Stress-induced imbalance of the OXT/AVP systems leads to an increased risk of various mental disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, and autism. At the same time, cognitive deficits are observed in stress and mental disorders, and perhaps peptide hormones play a part in this. The final part of the review describes possible therapeutic strategies for the use of OXT and AVP for treatment of various mental disorders."

Studies of self-harming behavior indicate that the upward trend is almost equally relevant for developing and developed countries. To date, the methodological basis for the diagnosis of NSSI has not been sufficiently developed in the Russian Federation, there are only some studies of NSSI both from an empirical perspective and in the context of the search for risk factors, causes and functions, models of comorbidity with mental disorders."

The study was conducted by clinical-psychopathological, clinical-catamnestic, and statistical methods. Teraligen was prescribed by psychiatrists to patients with STD in 74.2% of cases, of which in 46.4% of cases patients received Teraligen even before the diagnosis of STD in connection with complaints of neurotic disorders (anxiety, fears and sleep disorders) (<i>n=</i>30), as well as in connection with autistic-like behavior (<i>n=</i>22). At the time of follow-up, 55% (<i>n=</i>83) of patients received Teraligen, of which 63.9% (<i>n=</i>53) of patients were prescribed it for the first time. The applied schemes of prescribing Teraligen for the treatment of anxiety-phobic, depressive and behavioral syndromes within the framework of the STD in a relatively age-related aspect are presented. The high frequency of prescribing Teraligen by psychiatrists and neurologists to children and adolescents with STD at different stages of observation is shown, which reflects the confidence of specialists in this drug. Teraligen has demonstrated a multidimensional pharmacological effect, including a mild antipsychotic effect, providing reduction of a wide range of psychopathological symptoms, with good tolerability and drug interaction. The study of the possibilities of Teraligen, both for monotherapy and for augmentation of the treatment of mental pathology in childhood, remains relevant."

Forty-eight male patients (mean age 19.4±2.9 years) with the first depressive episode (ICD-10 F32.1, F32.2) with attenuated positive, negative and/or disorganized symptoms were examined. According to the severity of impulsivity, the patients were divided into the clinical group (<i>n</i>=26) with pathological impulsivity and the comparison group (<i>n</i>=27) without it. The control group consisted of 41 mentally healthy young men, students of higher education of 1-3 courses, (mean age 19.7±1.6 years). HDRS, SOPS, SANS, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) and Buss Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) were used. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Statistica 12 software. The differences between the clinical group and the comparison group were determined by the total score of the subscale of general symptoms of SOPS at admission (53 [41.75; 56] and 45.5 [41.75; 51.25], respectively) (<i>U</i>=187.5; <i>p</i>=0.037) and at discharge (28 [19; 37] and 25 [17.75; 29.25] points respectively) (<i>U</i>=166.5; <i>p</i>=0.012), according to the total HDRS score at admission (35 [31; 38] and 29 [26; 34.25]) (<i>U</i>=191.0; <i>p</i>=0.046).

Supposedly these changes are underlying some disorders. Difference in state and reactivity of the HPA system is well established. But the role of DKOS is not clear. Further study of this requires summarizing of the literature data on physiology of DKOS activation and ethological features of the activation in different periods of postnatal development. It is possible to conclude that the mode of reaction to stimulation of the DKOS differs in the early development in contrast to adult animals. The mode of reaction can be changed in relation to the periods of development of the system of stress-reactivity and can depend on prior activation of the stress system in a particular period."

To assess the severity and dynamics of their condition, we administered psychopathological analysis and common psychometric scales as well as our own version of the scale for benzodiazepine dependence. The diagnosis of drug dependence was based on the three criteria: symptoms of pathological dependence of benzodiazepine, benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome with severe somatic/autonomic symptoms and exacerbation of dependence, increase in tolerability to benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics; 64.3% of the patients met these criteria. An analysis of risk factors for this disease in elderly demonstrated the higher risk in patients aged ≤ 60 years and in those who used diazepam.

        "abstract": "<b>The aim of the study</b> was to identify genetic markers of schizophrenia based on exome sequencing data, as well as to specify its potential relation to clinical manifestations of the disease, morphological changes in the brain and immune disorders. The analyzed sample consisted of 48 patients (23 men and 25 women; average age - 31.5±7.7 years) having a confirmed diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. 140 genes with differential polymorphisms and enriched categories that may be related to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia were identified. Analysis of genes with differential frequencies of functionally significant common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by their major functions showed that the most common were genes involved in regulation of immune system functions and development of the nervous system, as well as genes being structural components of neurons and glia involved in the perception of sensory stimuli. The findings confirm the complexity of the genetic basis of schizophrenia. Analysis of the top 10 genes containing the most differential polymorphisms specifies such genes related to schizophrenia as <i>MUC12</i> and <i>SH3KBP1</i>. The genes involved in regulation of the immune response include <i>HLA-DQB2</i> which is one of the most significantly different SNPs between the group of patients and the general population; <i>HLA-DQB2</i> SNP (rs9276572) in patients is related to the signs of dysfunction of the antiviral component of immune system, structural changes in the brain and cognitive challenges. Although most of the detected genes are unique to the sample studied, additional studies are required to confirm these genes' involvement in the pathogenesis of this disease as well as to identify the mechanisms of the disease onset and development. The rs9276572(C) polymorphism of <i>HLA-DQB2</i> requires further study as a new potential marker of immunological disorders, morphometric changes in the brain and cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The data obtained indicate the need for personalized medicine, because the majority of genetic prerequisites are patient-specific and highlight the importance of further research to understand the genetic aspects of schizophrenia and develop innovative approaches to its diagnosis and treatment."

The results showed that the BAD subgroups with and without psychotic manifestations, types I and II BAD, have different structures of the neurocognitive profile and the depth and severity of cognitive impairment, which can be assumed to reflect differences in the neurobiological mechanisms of these disorders. For future studies, it is interesting to compare the neurocognitive profile and psychopathological manifestations of the subgroups discussed to study BAD further. Evaluating the neurocognitive profile of BAD subgroups may increase the effectiveness of the diagnosis and therapy.

Cognitive performance was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric methods. Patients with severe polymorphic psychotic symptoms had the most pronounced cognitive deficit (MMSE on Day 0 was 22.5 [20; 26] points, MoCA on Day 0 was 16 [12; 19] points, <i>p</i><0.05), which partially improved after treatment, but remained below the reference values (MMSE on Day 28 was 24.5 [22; 26] points, MoCA on Day 28 was 18.5 [17; 22] points). In patients with paranoid symptoms, cognitive impairment was less pronounced (MMSE on Day 0 was 26 [24; 28] points, MoCA on Day 0 was 0 [17; 24.5] points) and stable (MMSE on Day 28 was 27 [25.5; 29.5] points, MoCA on Day 28 was 21 [17; 25] points). In the group where affective-delusional symptoms prevailed, the cognitive deficit was minimal (MMSE on Day 0 was 27.5 [27; 28.5] points, MoCA on Day 0 was 24 [23; 26.5] points) and completely reduced after treatment (MMSE on Day 28 was 29 [28; 30] points, MoCA on Day 28 was 26 [25; 28] points).

The activity of leukocyte elastase (LE), functional activity of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor (α1-PI) and the level of autoantibodies (aAB) to S-100 and basic myelin protein were measured. A significant increase in LE and α1-PI was found in patients compared to controls (p<0.001). The level of aAB to neuroantigens was similar in patients and controls. The increase in LE activity was positively correlated with HAM-D depressive symptoms and SOPS total scores (r=0.47, p=0.02). Correlations between α1-PI activity and scores on SOPS positive subscale (r= -0.61, p=0.002) and SOPS total scores (r= -0.43, p=0.04) were identified. After treatment, the improvement of patient's state assessed by SOPS and HAM-D was correlated with the decrease in LE activity in 80% (p<0.01). The further increase of LE activity in 20% may be considered as an indicator of low quality remission and risk of psychosis manifestation. Patients with nonpsychotic mental disorders with higher levels of inflammation markers may be attributed to high risk group."

        "abstract": "Genetic isolates, which provide outstanding opportunities for identification of susceptibility genes for complex diseases, can be classified as primary (having an ancient demographic history in a stable environment) or secondary (having a younger demographic history) Neel [1992: Minority populations: Genetics, demography, and health, pp. 1-13]. Daghestan contains 26 out of 50 indigenous Caucasus ethnicities that have been in existence for hundreds of generations in the same highland region. The ethnic groups are subdivided into numerous primary isolates. The founder effect and gene drift in these primary isolates may have caused aggregation of specific haplotypes with limited numbers of pathogenic alleles and loci in some isolates relative to others. These are expressed as inter-population differences in lifetime prevalence and features of certain complex clinical phenotypes and in patterns of genetic linkage and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Stable highland and ethnic-cultural environments have led to increased penetrance and a reduced number of phenocopies, which typically hamper the identification of any susceptibility genes for complex diseases. Owing to these characteristics of the primary isolates, a comparative linkage study in the primary isolates allows us to define the number of susceptibility genes for any complex disease and to identify the source of variability and non-replication of linkage analysis results. As part of an ongoing study, seven extended schizophrenia and one nonspecific mental retardation kindreds have been ascertained from Daghestan isolates. Lifetime morbid risk for schizophrenia in the isolates varied from 0 to 5%. A genome scan with markers spaced 10 cM apart was carried out on these pedigrees and linkage analysis was performed using descent graph methods, as implemented in Simwalk2. To identify regions containing susceptibility genes within these kindreds, we followed up those regions with non-parametric and parametric linkage analyses, with the choice of genetic model guided by the results obtained in the NPL. While the analyses are ongoing, the most positive findings were made in different isolated pedigrees on chromosomes 17p11, 3q24, and 22q for schizophrenia and on chromosome 12q for nonspecific mental retardation."

        "abstract": "The article is devoted to recent researches in the field of fundamental knowledge about the mechanisms of information processing in human brain for the diagnosis of mental disorders performed in the laboratory of neurobiology for action programming of the Bechtereva Institute of Human Brain, RAS. These researches were connected with analysis of functional components for cognitive ERPs obtained in diverse behavioral conditions. The main goal of this fundamental approach is the decomposition of multi-channel ERPs into functionally different components. These components are generated in various cortical areas have different temporal dynamics and reflect a variety of mental operations. The main methodology we used is the independent component analysis, applied to a large set of ERPs (from hundreds of people) obtained by varying of functional conditions in one psychological test. In particular, components related to psychological processes such as the comparison of sensory signals with the trace in working memory, inhibition of current activity, monitoring of the conflict were identified in the GO/NOGO test. In the framework of European project normative database was constructed for the components described above and this allowed comparing the data obtained from large groups of patients (including patients with attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive disorders, depression, autism, dyslexia, brain trauma and dementia) with the healthy subjects. This article presents data from patients with a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder and schizophrenia."

A total of 115 patients with documented SLE (age 24-45 years, median 34 years, SLE duration 4-17, median 8 years) participated in the study. SLE activity was evaluated by SLEDAI scale, atherosclerosis--by ultrasonic arterial dopplerography, mental disorders--by psychological and psychic scales according to IDC-10. Mental disorders were detected in 76 of 115 (66%) patients: anxiety and depression (83%), depression episodes (40%), maladaptation (24%), generalized anxiety (10%), dysthymia (9%). Manifest cognitive disorders were seen in 7% of examinees. SLE patients with and without mental disorders did not differ by age, gender, SLE duration and activity, cumulative doses of glucocorticoids and cytotoxic drugs, but differed by diagnosed atherosclerosis (23 and 8%, respectively). All SLE patients with the history of myocardial infarction had mental disorders. SLE patients with antiphospholipid syndrome had mental disorders in 85%, while controls--in 49%. Mental disorders are found frequently in SLE patients (66%). 83% of these disorders are anxiodepressive. Incidence of mental disorders in SLE patients do not correlate with age, gender, SLE duration and activity, doses of glucocorticoids and cytotoxic drugs, but correlate with comorbid diseases (atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, acute cerebral attacks, antiphospholipid syndrome and Sjogren's syndrome."

The aim of the present study is to explore the possible relationships between number and frequency of depressive episodes and clinical variables associated to bipolarity, in a large sample of MDD patients. the clinical characteristics of 7055 patients with MDD were analyzed and compared according to the number and frequency of depressive episodes. Two stepwise backward logistic regression model were used to identify the predictive value of clinical features based on the presence of high number (≥3 episodes) and high frequency (≥3 episodes/year) of depressive episodes. high-recurrence and high-frequency MDD patients showed greater family history for bipolar disorder, higher prevalence of psychotic features, more suicide attempts, higher rates of treatment resistance and mood switches with antidepressants (ADs) and higher rates of bipolarity diagnosis according to Angst criteria, compared to low-recurrence and low-frequency patients. Logistic regressions showed that a brief current depressive episode, a previous history of treatment resistance and AD-induced mood switches, a diagnosis of bipolarity and comorbid borderline personality disorder were the variables associated with both high-recurrence and high-frequency depression. the study participating centers were not randomly selected and several variables were retrospectively assessed. even in the absence of hypomanic/manic episodes, high-recurrence and high-frequency MDD seem to be in continuity with the bipolar spectrum disorders in terms of clinical features and, perhaps, treatment response."

Some polymorphic variants of the human <i>Tph2</i> gene are associated with psychiatric disorders. <b>Area covered</b>: This review focuses on the mechanisms underlying the association between the TPH2 activity and behavioral disturbances in models of psychiatric disorders. Specifically, it discusses: 1) genetic and posttranslational mechanisms defining the TPH2 activity, 2) behavioral effects of knockout and loss-of-function mutations in the mouse <i>Tph2</i> gene, 3) pharmacological inhibition and the activation of the TPH2 activity and 4) alterations in the brain TPH2 activity in animal models of psychiatric disorders. We show the dual role of the TPH2 activity: both deficit and excess of the TPH2 activity cause significant behavioral disturbances in animal models of depression, anxiety, aggression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, schizophrenia, and catalepsy. <b>Expert opinion</b>: Pharmacological chaperones correcting the structure of the TPH2 molecule are promising tools for treatment of some hereditary psychiatric disorders caused by loss-of-function mutations in the human <i>Tph2</i> gene; while some stress-induced affective disorders, associated with the elevated TPH2 activity, may be effectively treated by TPH2 inhibitors. This dual role of TPH2 should be taken into consideration during therapy of psychiatric disorders."

        "abstract": "Hypersexual disorder (HD) was proposed as a diagnosis in the DSM-5 and the classification 'Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder' is now presented as an impulse-control disorder in ICD-11. HD incorporates several pathophysiological mechanisms; including impulsivity, compulsivity, sexual desire dysregulation and sexual addiction. No previous study investigated HD in a methylation analysis limited to microRNA (miRNA) associated CpG-sites. The genome wide methylation pattern was measured in whole blood from 60 subjects with HD and 33 healthy volunteers using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip. 8,852 miRNA associated CpG-sites were investigated in multiple linear regression analyses of methylation M-values to a binary independent variable of disease state (HD or healthy volunteer), adjusting for optimally determined covariates. Expression levels of candidate miRNAs were investigated in the same individuals for differential expression analysis. Candidate methylation loci were further studied for an association with alcohol dependence in an independent cohort of 107 subjects. Two CpG-sites were borderline significant in HD - cg18222192 (MIR708)(<i>p</i> < 10E-05,<i>p</i><sub>FDR</sub> = 5.81E-02) and cg01299774 (MIR4456)(p < 10E-06, <i>p</i><sub>FDR</sub> = 5.81E-02). MIR4456 was significantly lower expressed in HD in both univariate (p < 0.0001) and multivariate (p < 0.05) analyses. Cg01299774 methylation levels were inversely correlated with expression levels of MIR4456 (p < 0.01) and were also differentially methylated in alcohol dependence (p = 0.026). Gene target prediction and pathway analysis revealed that MIR4456 putatively targets genes preferentially expressed in brain and that are involved in major neuronal molecular mechanisms thought to be relevant for HD, e.g., the oxytocin signalling pathway. In summary, our study implicates a potential contribution of MIR4456 in the pathophysiology of HD by putatively influencing oxytocin signalling."

The study included 54 patients, 30 men and 18 women. After a year, 51 patients were re-admitted, in 2 years - 48 patients (6 patients were not included in the end). Average age at the beginning of the study was 65.6 ±3.7 years. The duration of the disease ranged from 2 to 8 years and averaged 5.9 ±4.2 years, the mean age at the onset of the disease was 58.4±4.3 years. The digital data was processed by a variational-statistical method. Student's t-test was used. Correlation analysis is performed by the method of Spearman's rank correlation. The diagnosis was established according to the criteria developed by Hughes et al. All patients underwent CT or MRI examination. Patients in clinical forms were divided into 3 groups: I group - rigid-bradykinetic form - 13 patients; Group II - the mixed (tremor-rigid) form 24 patient; Group III - the trembling form - 11 patients. The mental sphere of the patients was studied on a psychomotor scale at the beginning of the study, after 1 and 2 years, the Blessed information-Memory-Concentration (BIMC) test was used. Studies have shown that with Parkinson's disease, along with motor impairments, mental sphere disorders occur, although not in all cases. Approximately in 25% of cases mental disorders are not detected. Clinically significant worsening of cognitive functions during 2 years is observed in 20.83% of patients. A vivid correlation between the mental deficit and clinical forms of the disease was not found (p<0.5)."

The patients were divided into two groups: a clinical group - 73 patients, who were inpatients or outpatients in the clinical departments of the Mental Health Research Center (MHRC) in 2019-2022, and a follow-up group - 70 patients who were inpatients or outpatients in the MHRC clinic in 2006-2010. The structure of BPD in adolescence was clinically heterogeneous, which allowed distinguishing three typological varieties: with phenomena of «affective storm», which was characterized by the dominance of affective disorders, including after completion of adolescence, with some stabilization of personality structure (type I); with the dominance of addictive patterns of the type of «adrenalinomania», in which one of the key positions was occupied by craving impairments, with a constant need to search for new extreme hobbies, the use of psychoactive substances, which persisted after the end of adolescence (type II); with the predominance of «cognitive dissociation», which was characterized by the most polymorphic picture of disorders, with the predominance of self-identification disorders with dissociative disorders that retain their severity after the end of adolescence (type III). An integrative assessment of outcomes showed that rather favorable results (47.37%) (χ<sup>2</sup>=23.37, <i>p</i>=0.001) prevailed at type I, type II was characterized by rather unfavorable (59.26%) and unfavorable results (22.22%) (χ<sup>2</sup>=12.75, <i>p</i>=0.013) and type III by rather unfavorable (79.17%) and unfavorable (8.33%) outcomes (χ<sup>2</sup>=16.75, <i>p</i>=0.002). In the nosological evaluation of the follow-up group, 80.0% of patients were diagnosed with BPD, in the rest of the patients there was a change in diagnosis: in 14.3% for schizotypal disorder, in 5.7% for an attack-like form of schizophrenia (χ<sup>2</sup>=13.8, <i>p</i>=0.008; χ<sup>2</sup>=14.5, <i>p</i>=0.006).

        "abstract": "One of the main problems of psychopharmacotherapy is high variability of therapeutic effects. The traditional clinical approach to the optimization of psychopharmacotherapy based on the characterization of the spectrum of drug action and individual characteristics of the disease has certain limitations. When the clinical approach is supplemented with pharmacokinetic measurements it becomes possible to specify the choice of drug and to select an individual regimen of administration ensuring an effective level of active forms of the drug in the blood. A successful development of the clinico-pharmacokinetic direction at the present stage is due to improvement and standardization of methods of clinical and pharmacokinetic examination which help to ensure a reliable pretreatment identification of patients potentially sensitive to pharmacotherapy, to determine all active forms of drugs in biomedia, to establish the correlation between therapeutic and side effects on the one hand and the active concentrations of these forms on the other, as well as to select the most informative clinical and pharmacokinetic parameters. The general theoretical and practical value of clinico-pharmacokinetic studies is confirmed by the findings accumulated by now."

In addition to the assessment of the clinical picture of a mental disease, it is necessary to take into consideration (as fully as possible) the genesis and character of the committed socially dangerous action (SDA). For this purpose it is recommended that the concept of the psychopathological mechanisms of SDA worded by the authors and their classification be made use of. The establishment in a mental patient of one of the distinguished mechanisms of SDA allows the differentiation of the intellectual and volitional signs of the judicial (psychological) criterion and scientific basing of the conclusion as to the patient's irresponsibility."

However, depression shows considerable heterogeneity in its course over time. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between parent depression symptom trajectories and (i) quality of life and social impairment and (ii) psychiatric disorder and depression symptoms in their offspring. Participants were from a longitudinal study of 337 parents with recurrent MDD and their adolescent offspring. Families were assessed on three occasions over four years. Parent depressive symptoms and current MDD diagnosis were assessed using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry. Adult quality of life and social impairment were derived from the EuroQol and current employment status. Psychiatric outcomes in offspring were assessed using the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment. Using latent class growth analysis, three distinct classes of parental depression symptoms were identified (asymptomatic, mild, and chronic high). Parent depression classes were associated with their own quality of life and social impairment, and with psychiatric disorder and depression symptoms in their offspring. (i) We were unable to test associations with specific offspring disorders, (ii) we did not address the direction of effects underlying associations, and (iii) the sample consisted primarily of mothers and findings may not generalise to depressed fathers. Longitudinal assessments of depressive symptoms in parents could help to identify families who are most in need of early intervention."

        "abstract": "Maternal Immune Activation (MIA) is a phenomenon of pathophysiological stimulation of the maternal immune system during gestation which potentially leads to functional and structural disturbances of fetal neurogenesis. It occurs due to the alteration of paracrine signals between the maternal organism and the developing nervous system of the fetus. Any disturbances in the brain at embryonic and early postnatal stages might compromise its natural developmental trajectory, which could potentially increase the risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive and bipolar disorders, etc. Presumably, all these conditions could initiate the development of age-related cognitive impairment in late ontogenesis, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and others. As the main immune cell population in the CNS, microglia both mediate its proper development and receive pathological stimuli from the maternal organism. This could lead to microglia premature activation and could become a part of the mechanisms of the fetal CNS development alterations. In this review, we discuss the role of prenatal activation of microglia in neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative disease development. We highlight approaches to modeling MIA, as well as sex differences in the morphological and functional state of microglia in the context of physiological conditions. There is a hypothesis discussed regarding the contribution of these distinctions to neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative disease incidence, prevalence, and progression in males and females."

Initially formed to detect genetic influences on brain measures, ENIGMA has grown to over 30 working groups studying 12 major brain diseases by pooling and comparing brain data. In some of the largest neuroimaging studies to date - of schizophrenia and major depression - ENIGMA has found replicable disease effects on the brain that are consistent worldwide, as well as factors that modulate disease effects. In partnership with other consortia including ADNI, CHARGE, IMAGEN and others<sup>1</sup>, ENIGMA's genomic screens - now numbering over 30,000 MRI scans - have revealed at least 8 genetic loci that affect brain volumes. Downstream of gene findings, ENIGMA has revealed how these individual variants - and genetic variants in general - may affect both the brain and risk for a range of diseases. The ENIGMA consortium is discovering factors that consistently affect brain structure and function that will serve as future predictors linking individual brain scans and genomic data. It is generating vast pools of normative data on brain measures - from tens of thousands of people - that may help detect deviations from normal development or aging in specific groups of subjects. We discuss challenges and opportunities in applying these predictors to individual subjects and new cohorts, as well as lessons we have learned in ENIGMA's efforts so far."

The study included 158 patients (89 boys and 69 girls), aged 15-17, with depressive pathology of various genesis, observed in the adolescent office of one of the Moscow psychoneurological dispensary in 2015-2020. The main research methods were clinical-psychopathological, clinical-follow-up, statistical. An analysis of the data demonstrated that adolescent depression can be observed within different diagnostic categories. Most often they were noted in patients with affective disorders (43%, <i>n=</i>68), emerging personality disorders (29%, <i>n=</i>46), schizotypal disorder (13%, <i>n=</i>21). The nosological affiliation of depression and its severity were associated with sex. In young men, depressive states were more often detected in the structure of emerging personality disorder (59.6%) and schizotypal disorder (15.7%), depressive states within affective disorders were detected in 22.5% of cases. In girls, most of the depressive episodes (69.6%) developed in the structure of affective disorders, less often in personality disorders (20.3%), and schizotypal disorder (10.1%). Depressive episodes in girls were predominantly of moderate severity, in boys the most common were mild depressions. Adolescent depressions are a nosologically heterogeneous group of affective disorders, differing in clinical phenomenology and prognosis. They are noted within the pathology of the affective spectrum, affective phases and psychogenic reactions acting in the dynamics of emerging personality disorders, within the framework of psychopathological diathesis, schizotypal disorder. The influence of sex on the development of depressive disorders is determined by the nosological framework of the condition."

Fifty-one male patients with YCED (duration 36.5±12.5 month) and 18 patients with youth depression without chronic course as a comparison group were examined. A neuropsychological battery of the following techniques was used to assess cognitive functioning: the Rey - Osterrieth complex figure test, the Design Fluency Test, the Verbal Fluency Test, the 20-question Test, the Color-Word Interference Test, arithmetic problem solving, compilation of stories based on Bidstrup's cartoons, SDMT, the Digit span. Based on the heterogeneity of psychopathological features of YCED, two types were identified: unitary depressions (type 1) and supplementary depressions (type 2). Among type 2 depressions, two subtypes were distinguished: with neurosis-like disorders (subtype 2.1) and with psychopathic-like disorders (subtype 2.2). The following significant differences between different types of YHED and comparison groups were revealed: on the scale «Copying», «Simultaneity « and points when reproducing the Rey-Osterritz figure (<i>p</i>=0.049, <i>p</i>=0.024 and <i>p</i>=0.043); performing the second series in the Digit Span (<i>p</i>=0.022); in the switching test (<i>p</i>=0.004) and the number of errors (<i>p</i>=0.046) in the Color-Word Interference Test; «expansion of the utterance program» when solving arithmetic problems (<i>p</i>=0.012). The total number of patterns in the «Visual Fluency» test and the execution time of the «Encryption» method were significantly lower in the YHED group (<i>p</i>=0.049 and <i>p</i>=0.046). Patients with YCED show signs of neurocognitive dysfunction. The patients of supplementary and unitary types of YCED demonstrate the differences in the neurocognitive profile. The revealed peculiarities show the perspective of YCED research and typification of chronic depression in adolescence due to the differences in the neurocognitive profile."

        "abstract": "This is the first longitudinal study to examine the relationship between depression and the labour market in Russia. Using data from 2011 to 2017, we identify the impact that not being in employment has on mental distress, and we explore the mechanism underlying the observed association. Using data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey - Higher School of Economics, we employ random-effects regression models to estimate the impact of employment conditions on the likelihood of reporting mental distress in Russia. This method allows us to distinguish between the selection effect associated with mental distress and direct causation. Controlling for a range of socio-economic and demographic characteristics, we find that unemployment and labour market inactivity are strong predictors of the likelihood of reporting depression and serious nervous breakdown. However, we find that rather than negative labour market events giving rise to mental distress, the selection effect actually dominates, and the direction of causality therefore operates in reverse. Knowledge of the underlying mechanism that links unfavourable labour market outcomes with mental distress is crucial for designing policies that can address this link. We argue that our findings provide grounds for the initiation of anti-stigma campaigns among employers, policymakers, health practitioners and politicians as well as the general population. Eradication of the perception that mental disorders are somehow different to 'real' illnesses will not only prevent Russians from self-selection into unemployment but may also transform outdated approaches to mental health care in Russia."

The microbiota has been found to be involved in the modulation of inflammation as well as in the development and function of the immune and nervous systems. It is assumed that in multicellular organisms, the nervous and immune systems have evolved together with the microbiota, being in interaction with it, in order to optimize the body's ability to adapt to a wide range of environmental stresses in order to maintain the constancy of its homeostasis. Normally, microbes live in stable communities, while under conditions of even mild or chronic social stress, significant shifts in the composition of the microbiota occur, which lead to the development of dysbiosis associated with changes in microbiota metabolites, which can lead to the formation of physiology and behavior characteristic of stress and depression. Microbes influence the activation of peripheral immune cells that regulate the response to neuroinflammation, brain damage, autoimmune responses, and neurogenesis. The review provides a brief overview of the normal gut microbiota, describes the factors influencing the state of the microbiota, and also discusses recent discoveries concerning the regulatory effect of the gut microbiota on CNS functions, the immune system, and inflammation in the pathogenesis of depression and anxiety."

Across the Russian regions, Republic of Tyva has one of the highest rates of child and adolescent suicide and the lowest life expectancy at birth. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and associations of mental health problems in Native Tyvinian children and adolescents using internationally recognised measures and diagnoses. A two-stage, two-phase design involved selection of schools in five rural settlements in Western Tyva and two schools in the capital city followed by selection of Native Tyvinian children in grades 3-4 (ages 9-10) and 6-7 (ages 14-15). In the first phase, a screening measure of psychopathology, the Rutter Teacher Questionnaire, was obtained on 1048 children with a 97% participation rate. In the second phase, more detailed psychiatric assessments were carried out for subgroups of screen-positive and screen-negative children. The prevalence of mental health problems was about 25%, ranging from 40% in adolescent boys from rural areas to 9% in adolescent girls from the city. The patterning of disorders and risk factors were similar to those in other countries, rural areas were associated with an increased risk of psychopathology.

RA activity was estimated from the DAS28 index, pain intensity and degree of fatigue by BPI and FSS scales respectively, the functional status and life quality by HAQ and EQ-5D. Psychic disorders were diagnosed by a psychiatrist in accordance with ICD-10 with the use of relevant psychiatric and psychological scales and methods. Pain perception was unrelated to the patients' age and RA duration. The multifactor analysis provided a basis for the prognostic model suggesting that the most severe pain in RA is related to the functional status and quality of life (VAS of general health status), hsCRP level, inflammatory activity index RA DAS28, peripheral platelet count, degree of fatigue (FSS) and depression (YADS), female sex. Depression and its severity is one more factor influencing pain perception in RA and accounting for functional insufficiency and low quality of life. Early diagnostics of psychic disorders (in the first place anxious and depressive ones) is mandatory to ensure effective combined therapy of pain in RA patients."

        "abstract": "To evaluate aggressiveness during a major depressive episode (MDE) and its relationship with bipolar disorder (BD) in a post hoc analysis of the BRIDGE-II-MIX study. A total of 2811 individuals were enrolled in this multicenter cross-sectional study. MDE patients with (MDE-A, n = 399) and without aggressiveness (MDE-N, n = 2412) were compared through chi-square test or Student's t-test. A stepwise backward logistic regression model was performed. MDE-A group was more frequently associated with BD (P < 0.001), while aggressiveness was negatively correlated with unipolar depression (P < 0.001). At the logistic regression, aggressiveness was associated with the age at first depressive episode (P < 0.001); the severity of mania (P = 0.03); the diagnosis of BD (P = 0.001); comorbid borderline personality disorder (BPD) (P < 0.001) but not substance abuse (P = 0.63); no current psychiatric treatment (P < 0.001); psychotic symptoms (P = 0.007); the marked social/occupational impairment (P = 0.002). The variable most significantly associated with aggressiveness was the presence of DSM-5 mixed features (P < 0.001, OR = 3.815). After the exclusion of BPD, the variable of lifetime suicide attempts became significant (P = 0.013, OR = 1.405). Aggressiveness seems to be significantly associated with bipolar spectrum disorders, independently from BPD and substance abuse. Aggressiveness should be considered as a diagnostic criterion for the mixed features specifier and a target of tailored treatment strategy."

An examination was carried out on day 2-7 after the disaster. A diagnosis of acute stress reaction (ASR) was made using DSM-IV-TR criteria with definition of 4 groups of symptoms: recurrent trauma surviving, avoidant symptoms, elevated excitability and dissociated symptoms. Besides the clinical examination, the questionnaires adapted for the study and drawing techniques have been used. Symptoms of recurrent trauma surviving occurred most often (79.2%). Avoidant symptoms were detected in 75% of the cases, elevated excitability--in 64.4%, dissociated symptoms--in 62.5%. Symptoms of all the groups were found in 43.8% of the cases that suggested the presence of pronounced distress. No statistically significant correlation between symptom severity and subject's age and sex was revealed. The presence of siblings and friends among those been lost, affected the severity of ASR expression, in particular, avoidant symptoms and dissociation, recurrent trauma surviving symptoms being less influenced.

        "abstract": "To establish clinico-pathogenetic ratios of delusional psychoses constituting the psychopathological space of paranoid schizophrenia and to determine clinical and pathogenetic validity of concepts of a single delusional psychosis (a model of chronic delusion with a staged course) and two endogenous delusional psychoses. A sample consisted of 56 patients (19 women, 37 men; the average age 39.7±9.3 years; average duration of the disease 10.6±9.1 years) with a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, continuous type of course (F20.00), developed at the age above 18 years. At the time of examination, the condition of the patients was determined by persistent delusional or hallucinatory delusional disorders. Clinical, pathopsychological, psychometric (SANS, SAPS, PANSS), immunological and statistical methods were used. The study substantiates a bimodal model of a single delusional psychosis with a polar arrangement of interpretive delusions and delusions of influence based on the phenomena of mental automatism, both in terms of the vector of development (toward the poles of negative/positive disorders) and in terms of the rate of progression. Psychopathological manifestations of interpretive delusions correlate with the slow evolving development of psychosis, the dimensional structure of the paranoid is limited to the limits of the delusional register; functional activity is represented by affiliation to negative changes, integration with personality anomalies ends with the transformation of positive disorders into pathocharacterological ones, corresponding to the post-processual development of the personality. Manifestation of delusional impact (syndrome of mental automatism) is manifested by the complication and maximum expansion of the spectrum of positive disorders; the dimensional structure is represented by a wide range of psychopathological disorders and is formed with the participation of processes of mental dissociation, reaching the level of delusional depersonalization; functional activity is high, which creates conditions for the formation of a «new» subpsychotic structure, a «psychotic character», which is an attenuated duplicate of delusional psychosis. In both groups of patients, a significant increase in the activity of inflammatory markers of leukocyte elastase (249.2 ((231.1-270.0); 272.2 (236.0-292.6) nmol/min∙ml) and alpha - 1 proteinase inhibitor (48.8 (46.0-55.0); 50.4 (42.1-54.8) IU/ml) was shown compared with controls (205.0 (199.8-217.3) nmol/min∙mL and 33.0 (31.0-36.0) IU/mL, <i>p</i><0.01, respectively). In the group of patients with delusions of influence, an increased level of antibodies to S-100B was also observed (0.88 (0.67-1.0) opt.density units) compared with the control values (0.7 (0.65-0.77) opt.density units, <i>p</i><0.05). The concept of the model is supported by the results of the immunological study, according to which interpretive delusions and delusion based on the mental automatism, indicates the different level of immunity tension, and a qualitative changes in immune reactivity (also due to different genetic burden)."

It was shown that neuroinfections, craniocerebral traumas, perinatal pathology of the nervous system and genetic predisposition play a certain role in the genesis of temporal epilepsy. Psychological examination of patients with temporal epilepsy revealed various disorders of neuropsychic processes in 27 children. In 5 cases computer-aided tomography of the brain revealed various changes including petrifacates, cysts, foci of gliosis with partial brain atrophy and deformation of the lateral ventricles."

However, despite significant advances in understanding the genetic basis of the disease and a rapidly growing amount of data on genes associated with cognitive functions, most of the variability of cognitive impairments in patients remains unexplained. The data on the functional complexity of the genome accumulated in the fields of molecular biology and genetics underscore the importance of studying epigenetic mechanisms of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia."

It is shown that the expansion of the boundaries of the 'autistic spectrum' concept led to a significant spread of data on its prevalence, depending on the time, diagnostic criteria, country and region. Stability of the diagnosis of ASD is not high and depends on the age of the child. Diagnostic practice in comorbid psychiatric disorders unfairly shifted toward ASD. At the same time, the hypothesis on the uniqueness of autistic manifestations in infancy is not convincingly confirmed. The practical aspect of the problem of the epidemiology of autism does not exclude, but on the contrary, presupposes early detection of nonspecific mental disorders followed by medical-psychological-pedagogical correction."

We aimed to determine bipolar/mixed feature frequency in a large MDD multinational sample with (High-Rec) and without (Low-Rec) >3 recurrences, comparing the two subsamples. We measured frequency of bipolarity/hypomanic features during current depressive episodes (MDEs) in 2347 MDD patients from the BRIDGE-II-mix database, comparing High-Rec with Low-Rec. We used Bonferroni-corrected Student's t-test for continuous, and chi-squared test, for categorical variables. Logistic regression estimated the size of the association between clinical characteristics and High-Rec MDD. Compared to Low-Rec (n = 1084, 46.2%), High-Rec patients (n = 1263, 53.8%) were older, with earlier depressive onset, had more family history of BD, more atypical features, suicide attempts, hospitalisations, and treatment resistance and (hypo)manic switches when treated with antidepressants, higher comorbidity with borderline personality disorder, and more hypomanic symptoms during current MDE, resulting in higher rates of mixed depression according to both DSM-5 and research-based diagnostic (RBDC) criteria. Logistic regression showed age at first symptoms < 30 years, current MDE duration ≤ 1 month, hypomania/mania among first-degree relatives, past suicide attempts, treatment-resistance, antidepressant-induced swings, and atypical, mixed, or psychotic features during MDE to associate with High-Rec. Number of MDEs for defining recurrence was arbitrary; cross-sectionality did not allow assessment of conversion from MDD to BD. High-Rec MDD differed from Low-Rec group for several clinical/epidemiological variables, including bipolar/mixed features. Bipolarity specifier and RBDC were more sensitive than DSM-5 criteria in detecting bipolar and mixed features in MDD."

This study aimed to explore patterns of and factors associated with low adherence to psychotropic medication during pregnancy. Multinational web-based study was performed in 18 countries in Europe, North America, and Australia. Uniform data collection was ensured via an electronic questionnaire. Pregnant women were eligible to participate. Adherence was measured via the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8). The Beliefs about Prescribed Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ-specific), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and a numeric rating scale were utilized to measure women's beliefs, depressive symptoms, and antidepressant risk perception, respectively. Participants reporting use of psychotropic medication during pregnancy (n = 160) were included in the analysis. On the basis of the MMAS-8, 78 of 160 women (48.8%, 95% CI: 41.1-56.4%) demonstrated low adherence during pregnancy. The rates of low adherence were 51.3% for medication for anxiety, 47.2% for depression, and 42.9% for other psychiatric disorders. Smoking during pregnancy, elevated antidepressant risk perception (risk≥6), and depressive symptoms were associated with a significant 3.9-, 2.3-, and 2.5-fold increased likelihood of low medication adherence, respectively. Women on psychotropic polytherapy were less likely to demonstrate low adherence. The belief that the benefit of pharmacotherapy outweighed the risks positively correlated (r = .282) with higher medication adherence. Approximately one of two pregnant women using psychotropic medication demonstrated low adherence in pregnancy. Life-style factors, risk perception, depressive symptoms, and individual beliefs are important factors related to adherence to psychotropic medication in pregnancy."

Likewise, in undergraduate and postgraduate medical curricula, prevention and mental health promotion have often been ignored. However, there has been a recent increase in interest in public mental health, including an emphasis on the prevention of psychiatric disorders and improving individual and community wellbeing to support life trajectories, from childhood through to adulthood and into older age. These lifespan approaches have significant potential to reduce the onset of mental illnesses and the related burdens for the individual and communities, as well as mitigating social, economic, and political costs. Informed by principles of social justice and respect for human rights, this may be especially important for addressing salient problems in communities with distinct vulnerabilities, where prominent disadvantages and barriers for care delivery exist.

        "abstract": "To determine the factors that shape attitudes towards people with severe mental disorders as well as to establish correlations between these factors and socio-demographic variables. Cross-sectional study was conducted among 1000 respondents in five regions of the country. The questionnaire included different aspects concerning the relation of society towards people with mental disorders. The study established three-factor structure of attitudes towards people with mental illness: social distance, perseption of social threat, tolerant attitude Older age and a personal acquaintance with the patient were associated with lower ratings of social distance, while female gender was associated with a greater level of perception of social threat. The tolerant attitude is positively correlated with marital status and familiarity with the patients, and negatively with the presence of mental illness in the family. The three-factor structure allows better understanding of various aspects in stigmatization of people with mental disorders."

        "abstract": "The authors suppose that adequate mental health care management should be based on the knowledge about the number of its potential patients. In order to determine this number the authors formulated a hypothesis that the necessary period of the observation of patients depends on the course of the disease and on the risk of the relapse. From the authors' point of view all mental disorders comprise 3 groups. Patients who belong to the 1-st group need observation during all their life; patients from the 2-nd group need observation during an active period of the illness; patients from the 3-d group need observation during the acute period only. On the basis of estimation of the full number of mentally ill people in Russia the authors calculate a size of each group and the total number of the potential patients--about 21 million of people (14% of the Russian population). This rate has been defined as \"the actual number of mental patients\"."

        "abstract": "On the basis of integrated clinical, dynamic, and neurophysiological examinations of 542 children and adolescents with behaviour deviations a high (54.05%) percentage of psychic anomalies (primarily, characterological ones) was discovered. The structure of the delinquent behaviour was found to be the most complicated in children and adolescents taught at special schools for juvenile offenders. In adolescents registered at the Inspection on Minors' Affairs this structure was of a more isolated character. An important role of combinations of constitutional-biological, exogenous-organic, and negative microsocial factors in the genesis of the juvenile delinquency is demonstrated. Clinical and laboratory examinations of \"difficult\" adolescents with distinct neuropsychic disturbances revealed substantial shifts in their cortical neurodynamics and the functioning of chemoreactive systems. On the basis of the data obtained a complex of differentiated therapeutic and hygienic measures aimed at attaining a regression of the borderline personality pathologies has been developed."

Two hundred and thirty-seven patients (180 male, 57 female), aged 16 to 25 years, with the first DE and comorbid personality disorder (PD) were clinically observed and psychopathologically evaluated. Later 149 patients from this group participated in the follow-up study. The first DE with PD in adolescence is characterized by psychopathological variety due to PD type and age factor. Diagnosis of PD in adolescence is based on pathological traits, while affective impairment is a separate dimension. PD determines the clinical features of the first DE and all spectrum of affective disorders. The high conjugation of the first DE with autoagressive behavior confirms their suicidal risk. Autoagressive behavior is noted in 201 (84.8%) patients, of which 59 (29.4%) had non-suicide self-injury (NSSI) and 14 (70.6%) had suicidal activity. The follow-up study identified variants of further dynamics of PD with comorbid affective spectrum disorders after the first DE developed in youth that had prognostic value: unipolar major depression in schizoid PD (13 (37.1%) patients), cluster C PD (8 (26.7%)); bipolar affective disorders in borderline (42 (28.2%)) and narcissistic (16 (40.0%)) PD; recurrent depressive disorder in PD of cluster C (14 (46.7%)). The revealed clinical and psychopathological features will contribute to the creation of a unified model for predicting affective disorders and the formation of therapy standards."

All the patients met the criteria of the International Study Group for BD (1990) classification. The disease activity was assessed by scoring system BDCAF. A diagnosis of a mental disorder (MD) was established by the psychiatrist in accordance with the ICD-10 using a semi-structured interview. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), a pathopsychological method 'Pictograms', clinical/psychological methods for assessment of cognitive functions (memory, attention concentration, logic thinking) were administered. Brain MRI was done in 44 (41.5%) BD patients. The study was conducted in the frames of the interdisciplinary program 'Stress factors and mental disorders in immune-mediated inflammatory rheumatic diseases'. CD of mild to moderate severity were diagnosed in 82 (77.4%) and anxiety-depressive disorders in 81 (76.4%) of BD patients. The patients with CD were older compared to patients without cognitive disorders (34.3±1.07 vs 29.0±2.14, p=0.006). Patients with CD were most often (84.1% vs 50.0%, p=0.001) diagnosed with anxiety-depressive disorder (anxiety, chronic/recurrent depression). MADRS scores were higher (16.1±0.74 vs 12.2±1.06, p=0.005) though did not exceed the moderate level. The impact of chronic psychosocial stressors was detected more often in CD patients. MRI results showed that the frequency of chronic multifocal, predominantly subcortical, changes in the white matter was higher in CD patients. CD are characteristic of most patients with BD. They are associated with the age, anxiety-depressive disorders, chronic stressors and minor brain multifocal subcortical parenchymal MRI lesions."

Patients with organic asthenic disorder were divided into two groups according to the prevailing symptoms: 36 patients with asthenic-cephalgic syndrome (AC); 10 patients with astheno-dysthymic syndrome (AD); the third group (<i>n</i>=14) included patients with organic anxiety disorder (AND). The control group consisted of 65 people matched for age and sex with patients. The activity of leukocyte elastase (LE) and α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1-PI) was determined by the spectrophotometric method, the levels of aAB to S100b and MBP were determined by ELISA. The protease-inhibitory index (PII), i.e., the ratio of LE activity to α1-PI, was calculated. A significant increase in LE (235.4 [216.4; 258.1] nmol/min*ml, <i>p</i><0.001), the functional activity of α1-PI (43.1 [38.7; 47.6] u/ml, <i>p</i><0.001), the level of aAB to S100b (0.78 [0.70; 0.89] opt.units, <i>p</i><0.05) and a decrease in PII (6.19 [5.32; 6.9], <i>p</i><0.05) in the group of patients with organic non-mental disorders compared with controls were shown. Deviations from the normal values of immune markers of inflammation in blood samples were also found in various syndromes. Clustering of the total group of patients by LE activity made it possible to identify 2 immunotypes with a balanced and unbalanced inflammatory process, confirming the clinical diversity of the disease: 60% of patients with AC syndrome belong to the 1st cluster, in which the ratio of immune markers characterizes a balanced inflammatory process aimed at restoration of homeostasis; 80% of patients with organic AND belong to the second cluster, which characterizes low proteolytic activity and imbalance of inflammation, which is an unfavorable prognostic factor in terms of the further course of the disease and therapy. The results confirm the importance of the inflammatory link in the neuroprogression of organic non-psychotic disorders. The identified features of the immune response can serve as an additional paraclinical criterion for differential diagnosis and evaluation of the prognosis of the further development of the disease."

The study included 186 male MIA pensioners in the Kirov region aged 34-64 years (mean 46.5±5.8 years). The participants were divided into two groups depending on their participation in combat operations: 106 retired combatants of the main group (MG) and 80 people who were not participants in combat operations during their service (the comparison group (CG)). We used a clinical/psychological method with the study of medical documentation, including acts of the military medical commission, protocols of the Center for psychophysiological diagnostics and outpatient patient records, experimental psychological method with the use of a standardized multi-factor method of personality research in L.Sobchik's adaptation. The stressful conditions of official activity associated with participation in local armed conflicts combined with premorbid neurotic overcontrol of behavior, rigid attitudes, pessimism and social introversion contribute to BMD and psychosomatic disorders formation in retired MIA combatants. MG combatants had a 5.2 - fold higher chance of developing a mental disorder according to the Cochran Q-test (95% CI: 2.7-10) than retired CG who did not participate in combat operations. There was an average correlation between the compared features (V=0.377). The results indicate the need to improve the approach to the professional psychological selection of candidates for service, taking into account the initial personality characteristics and functional characteristics of the proposed position.

Recent genome-wide studies reported about 600 genes potentially influencing neuroticism. Little is known about the mechanisms of their action. Here, we aimed to conduct a more detailed analysis of genes that can regulate the level of neuroticism. Using UK Biobank-based GWAS summary statistics, we performed a gene-based association analysis using four sets of within-gene variants, each set possessing specific protein-coding properties. To guard against the influence of strong GWAS signals outside the gene, we used a specially designed procedure called \"polygene pruning\". As a result, we identified 190 genes associated with neuroticism due to the effect of within-gene variants rather than strong GWAS signals outside the gene. Thirty eight of these genes are new. Within all genes identified, we distinguished two slightly overlapping groups obtained from using protein-coding and non-coding variants. Many genes in the former group included potentially pathogenic variants. For some genes in the latter group, we found evidence of pleiotropy with gene expression. Using a bioinformatics analysis, we prioritized the neuroticism genes and showed that the genes that contribute to neuroticism through their within-gene variants are the most appropriate candidate genes."

A literature review on late-onset schizophrenia and VLOSLP was conducted based on publications from PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases up to December 2023. It may be noted that research into schizophrenia has largely focused on early-onset patients, and research into the mental health of older people has focused primarily on dementia and depression, with relatively little information on late-onset schizophrenia and VLOSLP. The nosology of late-onset functional psychoses is still poorly understood. There is currently no consensus on the diagnostic framework for psychosis labeled by the term VLOSLP. These deficiencies need to be addressed in order to understand the background of VLOSLP, the course and prognosis of the illness, and to develop successful management and treatment strategies for these patients, as older adults are more susceptible to the adverse effects of psychotropic medications. Therapy should be holistic, including not only medication but also psychotherapy, and the key role of caregivers of elderly schizophrenia patients should be taken into account.

Panic attacks were followed by objective increase of both AD and HR in only 1/3 of the cases and by objective HR increase in 60% of the patients. Although patients with panic attacks were normothymics, hypertensive reactions can arise in them, during sleep for the most part. Alteration of HR variability in sleep-awakening cycle was the most paradoxical (excess HR variability in awakening state and decreased change during a sleep). These alterations of HR variability persisted after control of panic attacks with fluoxetine. This allows to consider HR variability as a factor which reflects predispositional peculiarities of autonomic system functioning in patients with panic disorders."

It was established that in epileptic patients the brain autoantigens were found in 30,8% of the cases, the antibrain antibodies in 7.7%. There was no correlation between the frequency of the detected brain antigens in the blood serum of the sick children, the sex, duration of the disease, hereditary loading and the genesis of epilepsy. Autoimmune shifts were seen in 28.15% of the cases in the blood of the relatives. Autoimmune shifts were found in the families of such children with autoimmune changes in 52.9% while among the relatives -- without autoimmune changes in 15.9% of the cases."

The study included 150 patients aged 7 to 16 years with a diagnosis of SD, of which 48 were female and 102 were male. Based on the age of onset of the first stable psychopathological disorders, at the stage preceding the diagnosis of SD, 5 groups of patients were identified: up to 3 years (<i>n</i>=38), from 4 to 6 years (<i>n</i>=36), from 7 to 10 years (<i>n</i>=15), 11-13 (<i>n</i>=41), 14-16 years old (<i>n</i>=20). The study used clinical-psychopathological, clinical-catamnestic, with a retrospective analysis, neurological, pathopsychological, psychometric and statistical research methods. A high frequency of deviations from normative parameters in early psychomotor development was found in 99 (65%) patients with STD. Mental retardation was observed in 23 (15%) patients, dissociation in mental development was detected in a significant number of patients - 62 (41%). At the same time, the most significantly more frequent and pronounced were violations in the two youngest groups with the onset of psychopathological disorders up to 6 years. In these groups, there was also more often a deficit in three areas at once - emotional, motivational and volitional (38%) compared with the 4<sup>th</sup> group (13%). In groups 1 and 2, a deficit in intellectual development was also characteristic, which was reflected in academic indicators. High performance in the primary grades was observed in 16% of patients in the 1<sup>st</sup> group versus 60% in the 5<sup>th</sup>, and poor performance was found in 37% in the 1<sup>st</sup> group and only 5% in the 5<sup>th</sup>. The relationship of clinical variants of STD with the selected groups was revealed. The diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder was significantly more often (66%) diagnosed in patients from group 1 compared with groups 3 and 5. In group 2, this diagnosis was established in a third of cases. The diagnosis of the psychopathic variant of STD was predominant in patients with the onset of the disorder between 7 and 13 years of age. The neurosis-like variant had a clear tendency to become more frequent with older age, reaching statistically significant differences in group 5 compared to group 1. The age of onset and duration of persistence of psychopathological disorders determines the level of negative changes that have formed at the stage of the disease preceding the onset of distinct clinical symptoms of STD. Age at onset determines the predominant positive disorder."

        "abstract": "Nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior (NSSI) is an important risk factor for future suicide attempts. Previous research has identified a number of motivations for engaging in NSSI. The aim of the present study was to translate the Inventory of Statements About Self-Injury (ISAS) into Russian and then to evaluate its psychometric properties in a sample of patients with non-psychotic mental disorders and suicidal ideation (SI). Other aims were to determine the prevalence of specific NSSI functions in this population and to assess the relationship between different NSSI functions and clinical and psychological parameters. The study was conducted at the largest center for non-psychotic mental disorders in Moscow. All admitted patients with both NSSI and SI completed the Russian version of the ISAS-II, underwent the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview, and completed the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 and ICD-11 Brief Form Plus-Modified, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. A total of 614 patients were included in the study. 543 (88.4%) patients were assigned female at birth with a mean age of 24.86 (7.86) years. Factor analysis supported a two-factor structure (Intrapersonal and Interpersonal) of the Russian version of the ISAS-II, but in contrast to the original study, the \"Marking distress\" function loaded more strongly on the Interpersonal factor. In people with non-psychotic mental disorders and SI, Interpersonal functions of NSSI are associated with more severe depressive symptoms (<i>r</i> = 0.34), 12 months history of NSSI (<i>r</i> = 0.30), higher number of NSSI methods (<i>r</i> = 0.41), likelihood of future NSSI (<i>r</i> = 0.35) and psychoticism (<i>r</i> = 0.32). The Russian version of the ISAS-II is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing NSSI functions in a population at high risk for suicide attempts. Interpersonal functions are associated with a number of unpleasant clinical and psychological features."

Psychiatric disorders share common variant risk, whereas neurological disorders appear more distinct from one another and from the psychiatric disorders. We also identified significant sharing between disorders and a number of brain phenotypes, including cognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for brain disorders and the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology."

        "abstract": "Using clinical procedures and psychological tests, the authors examined 72 patients with tumours of the left, and 68 with those of the right frontal lobe of the brain. Tumours of the left frontal lobe were shown to be associated with such manifestations as an impoverishment of motor activity and facial mobility, speech disturbances in the form of efferent motor or dynamic aphasia, slower rate of mental processes, impaired verbal memory, diminished capacity for generalization, difficulty in switching attention to another subject, and inclination toward stereotypy. These disturbances were attended by depressive emotions at the initial, and by the apathoabulic syndrome at the later stages. Tumours located in the right frontal lobe resulted in excessive elation and euphoria, underestimation of the gravity of one's condition and anosognosia, noncritical perception of reality, lack of concentration, diminution in the volume of perception, and a tendency toward confabular additions, which was particularly manifest in the sphere of visual perceptions. The local factor appears to play the principal part in the development of psychic disorders related to the left frontal tumours, whereas in cases of the right frontal tumours, it is the size and the degree of malignancy that matter."

The time of perception and time of motor reactions to a simple stimula were practically identical to those in normals. The time of motor reactions to aletter stimula was higher than to a simple one and in patients significantly higher than in normals. Under the influence of alcohol the time of perception and motor reactions increase in conditions of letter distinguishing. These facts permit to consider that alcohol in such patients makes the processing of information in the CNS slower and most strongly influences the central cortical processes."

Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder both in the general population and in patients with multimorbid pathology. Its prevalence in the general population is 6-15%, while in patients with somatic diseases it increases up to 20-40% and can reach 90% in patients with comorbid mental disorders. Another problem is the development of drug-induced insomnia. Insomnia has negative impact on the prognosis of comorbid diseases, including an increased risk of death, more severe disease, and a worse quality of life. The presence of sleep disorders makes it difficult to effectively treat the underlying disease, so it is extremely important to identify and correct these disorders in the early stages, therefore recommendations for the diagnosis of insomnia in polymorbid patients are proposed. Modern methods of treating acute and chronic insomnia and features of insomnia treatment in polymorbid patients are also discussed."

The study aimed at analyzing negative symptoms in schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders from historical and modern perspectives. An analysis of available literature, along with own observations, has been performed. It was found that negative symptoms comprise 3 clinical types: 1) 'pseudopsychopathic' type (overlapping personality dimensions and premorbid/initial negative symptoms), 2) pseudoorganic/asthenic/pseudobradiphrenic type (pseudoorganic states), developing at different stages of schizophrenia), 3) 'new'-life pseudopsychopathic type (not associated with premorbid personality traits), developing at late stages in schizophrenia. The trajectory heterogeneity of negative symptoms in their relation to positive symptoms has been defined: simultaneous-continuous course (synchronous course of positive and negative symptoms), polar course (alternative development of predominantly positive or negative symptoms), simultaneous-phasic course (pseudopsychopathic negative symptoms, attracting depressive symptoms, or depression that exacerbates latent deficit). The authors discuss some aspects of psychopharmacological treatment of negative symptoms. Negative symptoms in schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders differ clinically, have heterogeneous trajectory course, and require differentiated approach with regard to psychopathological qualification, prognosis and treatment."

A sufficient bulk of information has been accumulated on changes in connectivity (links between brain regions) in psychopathologies, for example, depression, schizophrenia, autism. Their genetic markers are being actively investigated using a candidate-gene approach or a genome-wide association study. At the same time, there is not much data considering connectivity as an intermediate link in the genotype-pathology chain, although it seems to be a reliable endophenotype, since it demonstrates a high stability and high heritability. In the present review, we consider the results of investigations devoted to the search for biomarkers, molecular and genetic associations of functional, partially anatomical, and effective connectivity. The main approaches to the evaluation of connectivity neurogenetics have been described, as well as specific genetic variants, for which the association with brain connectivity in psychiatric pathologies has been detected."

The analysis shows that 90% of patients were aged 40-59 years, 59.6% of them were women. In every third patient (33.3%), clinical signs of psychosis were observed for five or more years before hospitalization and diagnosis, and in 14.9% for more than 10 years, the average duration of psychosis before diagnosis was 5.1 years. Markers of psychosis were non-specific factors of family adaptation, working capacity, and substance use, which revealed relationships with gender characteristics and age of diagnosis of psychosis. Better adaptation parameters correlated with the female sex and later diagnosis of schizophrenia, lower indicators were more typical for the male sex and earlier diagnosis. Signs of increasing social maladjustment should be alarming to the patient's relatives, as well as social and medical services. In addition, the timely diagnosis of psychosis requires psychoeducation of the population, training of social workers and primary health care professionals."

COVID-19 adversely affects human health not only in the acute period of the disease, but also in the long-run: in a large percentage of cases, recovery takes very long, patients require and often have problems returning to their baseline. During the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, researchers noted that about 10-20% of patients didn't fully recover three weeks after the onset of the disease. It is still not clear how long the recovery period can last, and what are the reasons of different time course of the recovery. Long-term recovery after a viral infection is a non-unique feature of COVID-19, which does not facilitate the management of patients with post-COVID syndrome. The impact on mental health after COVID-19 is significant, and at least 30% of those, who have been ill, may have symptoms of anxiety and/or depression after the acute phase of the disease. Since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there has been an increase in somnological disorders by 42%, while every third COVID-19 patient reports altered sleep patterns. In post-COVID-19 syndrome, this condition is referred to as Coronasomnia (COVID-somnia). The success of therapy of this condition depends on reporting and treating mental disorders in patients, as anxiety and depression are often accompanied by sleep disorders, that is, there is a bidirectional influence of mental disorders on the quality of sleep. The article provides data on two anti-anxiety drugs (noofen and adaptol) that help to treat the manifestations of post-COVID syndrome accompanied by sleep disorders."

The number of people with non-psychotic mental disorders with the prevalence of organic mental disorders (cognitive and asthenic) was significantly higher among in-utero exposed subjects. A neurophysiological study revealed more severe changes in the bioelectric brain activity with the presence of pathological and theta-rhythms in exposed persons. The clinical-psychological study revealed a significant decrease in the analytic/synthetic ability in exposed people and significantly lower level of the general and verbal IQ. These changes were accompanied by higher levels of cortisol and melatonin which led to the activation and tension of the adaptation mechanisms in in-utero exposed subjects."

        "abstract": "The special group termed as \"somatic fantasies\" (SF) was distinguished among pathological somatic sensations of heteronomous character. Psychopathological structure of SF differed from senestopathias in some signs: objectiveness--the sensation achieved the level of the real perception of physical phenomena and objects; formal-geometrical organisation--the possibility of their parametric estimation (in form, volume, size, etc.); space location--the clear correlation of feelings with certain organ or physiological process; dynamic characteristics-- variability, mobility. The description of somatic sensations was characterized by allegory image as well as by metaphorical, affective saturation as compared with senestopathias. SF were observed in patients with borderline mental disorders in accordance with the 1CD-10 diagnostical headings: schizotypic disorder (F21), anxious phobic disorders (F40, F41), dissociative disturbances (F44), somatoform disorders (F45). 19 patients (6 males, 11 females; mean age 32.6 years) formed the group examined. Two variations of SF were recognized which correlated with hysterical or schizotypic disorders of personality."

In the BRIDGE-II-MIX multicenter, cross-sectional study, 2,811 individuals suffering from a major depressive episode (MDE; DSM-IV-TR criteria), in the context of bipolar I or II disorder (BD-I, BD-II, respectively) or major depressive disorder, were enrolled between June 2009 and July 2010. Patients with (MDE-AL, n = 694) and without (MDE-noAL, n = 1,883) AL and with (MDE-MR, n = 1,035) or without (MDE-noMR, n = 1,542) MR were compared through χ² test or Student t test. Stepwise backward logistic regression models, respectively testing AL and MR as the dependent variable, were performed to differentiate the 2 clinical constructs. AL was positively associated with BD-I (P < .001) and BD-II (P < .001), with DSM-5 mixed (DSM-5-MXS) (P < .001) and atypical (DSM-5-AD) features (P < .001) and negatively associated with MDD (P < .001). In the logistic regression models, MR was the variable most significantly associated with AL and vice versa (P < .001 for both). AL was positively associated with severity of mania and DSM-5-MXS and negatively correlated with severity of depression, while MR was better predicted by atypical symptoms such as hyperphagia, hypersomnia, and leaden paralysis and correlated with both comorbid anxiety disorders and DSM-5-MXS. Mixed and atypical depression may lie on the same continuum. MR and AL could represent the underlying matrix, bridging the gap between mixed and atypical depression."

The exclusion criteria were the presence of psychotic episodes, severe deficiency symptoms, as well as clinically significant somatic, neurological and mental disorders that complicated the study. Clinical-psychopathological, psychometric (HDRS, SANS and SOPS) and statistical methods were used. Youth chronic endogenous depression is characterized by the dominance of symptoms of negative affectivity in their structure. In addition, there are disorders that differ from those of an affective spectrum. Based on the analysis of psychopathological characteristics of youth chronic endogenous depressions, two typological varieties are identified: unitary depressions (type I) and supplementary depressions (type II). Among type II depressions, 2 subtypes are distinguished: with neurosis-like and with psychopathic- like disorders.

LD score regression was used to investigate genetic correlations between neuroticism and the 34 health outcomes. Mendelian randomization was performed to investigate mutual causal relationships between neuroticism and the 34 health outcomes. Neuroticism genetically correlates with a majority of health-related traits and confers causal effects on 12 mental traits (major depressive disorder (MDD), insomnia, subjective well-being (SWB, negatively), schizophrenia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, alcohol dependence, loneliness, anorexia nervosa, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychiatric disorders) and two physical diseases (cardiovascular disease and hypertensive disease). Conversely, MDD, SWB, and insomnia have a causal effect on neuroticism. We highlighted key genes contributing to the causal associations between neuroticism and MDD, including RBFOX1, RERE, SOX5, and TCF4, and those contributing to the causal associations between neuroticism and cardiovascular diseases, including MAD1L1, ARNTL, RERE, and SOX6.

Occurrence and signs of PMD were studied in 417 patients with brain injuries and their consequences. It was found that occurrence of PMD in clear consciousness (in form of delirium, confusion etc) is often a sign of deterioration of cerebral and/or somatic situation and requires urgent diagnostic and therapeutic measures. In another situation with PMD being revealed during emergence from coma, they are regarded as a prognostically favorable sign and require some correction only in case of long-term (more than 1-3 weeks) course. It was determined that PMD are characterized by: (a) a gradual (after emergence from unconsciousness) aggravation and complications of clinical symptoms till achieved orientation in the surroundings with their possible partial or complete regress; (b) the highest frequency and intensity with prevailed signs of dysfunction of any of cerebral hemispheres and the lowest frequency in case of relatively symmetric bilateral and profound brain damage; b) a great variety and severity in adult patients (compared with children and elderly).

Several types of endogenous depression were identified: 1) hysterical depression with hysterical-conversions, and also the phenomena of delusional fantasies; 2) dysmorphic depression with predominance of over-valued ideas of physical disability, self-inferiority and eating disorder; 3) depersonalization depression with depersonalization-derealization symptoms; 4) psychopath-like depression with exaggerated behavior, opposition and impulsivity; 5) existential depression with a feeling of losing the life meaning and often pessimistic worldview; 6) psychasthenic depression with the low self-esteem and exaggerated introspection combined with obsessive-phobic disorder; 7) anxious-melancholic depression with anxiety, melancholy and ideas of self-accusation and self-inferiority; 8) depression with symptoms of adolescent asthenic insolvency with difficulties of understanding information, increasing intellectual exhaustion. We revealed differences in motives for committing non-suicidal self-harm behavior and suicidal behavior in typological variants of depressions. Hysteroform and psychopathic depressions prevail in personality disorders, while psychosthenic-like, anxious-melancholic and existential depressions are more frequent in affective disorders.

It was possible to demonstrate an excessive degree of vegetative provision in all groups the following factors: the localization of the process, the initial degree of vegetative disturbances, the expressiveness of emotional changes. In a moderate expressiveness of psycho-vegetative disturbances there is a higher degree of vegetative provisions than in expressed psychovegetative syndromes. These data may serve as an explantation to the origination of such clinical conditions as asthenical states and disorders of adaptation in different forms of activity."

        "abstract": "The prevalence of bipolar II disorder (BD-II) in Russia has never been studied. Therefore, we sought to identify patients meeting diagnostic criteria for BD-II among patients with a current diagnosis of recurrent depressive disorder (RDD) through the use of the Russian versions of the Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32) and Bipolarity Index scales for differentiating between BD-II and RDD. In a non-interventional diagnostic study, we selected 409 patients aged between 18 and 65 years from two medical settings with (i) a current diagnosis of RDD, (ii) an illness duration of at least three years, and (iii) at least two affective episodes. The diagnosis was based on clinical assessment and confirmed by the Russian version of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. All patients were assessed by the HCL-32, the Bipolarity Index, and the Personal and Social Performance Scale. Among patients with a current diagnosis of RDD, 40.8% had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (bipolar I disorder: 4.9%; BD-II: 35.9%). The average time lag from onset to a correct diagnosis of BD-II was 15 years and patients were treated only with antidepressants. The sensitivity of the Russian version of the HCL-32 at the optimal cutoff point (≥14.0) was 83.7%, and its specificity was 71.9%. The Bipolarity Index showed significant differences between the total scores of the patients with BD-II and RDD (31.8 versus 20.2; p < 0.0001). The optimal threshold was ≥22.0 (sensitivity 73.5%; specificity 72.3%). In Russia, diagnostic errors are an important cause of the non-detection of bipolar disorder, particularly BD-II. The Russian version of the HCL-32 and the Bipolarity Index, as additional tools, could be useful for bipolarity screening."

        "abstract": "Overdose is a serious problem as for people addicted to opioid drug injections (ODI) as well as for the community in general. To study characteristics of overdose, authors examined 60 ODI users and analyzed 27 overdose death cases. It has been shown that overdose is rather common among ODI users. Fatal and nonfatal overdoses most frequently take place among men at home or in the street. People often did not receive sufficient help in the overdose situation. We confirm the role of alcohol, long abstinence and variability in drug quality in the development of overdose. Witnesses of overdose in other users reported more health problems, family and social relations, were more concerned with their own and others risk in future compared to those reporting no overdose. Additional predictors were determined: a higher number of overdoses in the past; disturbances of family relations and somatic disorders. Mental disorders predicted the opioid overdose risk among ODI users. ODI users are interested in counseling and training to prevent overdose. Family psychotherapy and early diagnosis of comorbid disorders may be important ways of overdose prevention."

        "abstract": "To diagnose mild cognitive impairment, it is crucial to understand whether subjective cognitive complaints reflect objective cognitive deficits. This question has mostly been investigated in the memory domain, with mixed results. Our study was one of the first to address it for language. Participants were 55-to-93-year-old memory clinic patients (<i>n</i> = 163). They filled in a questionnaire about subjective language and memory complaints and performed two language tasks (naming-by-definition and sentence comprehension). Greater language complaints were associated with two language measures, thus showing a moderate value in predicting language performance. Greater relative severity of language versus memory complaints was a better predictor, associated with three language performance measures. Surprisingly, greater memory complaints were associated with better naming, probably due to anosognosia in further disease progression or personality-related factors. Our findings highlight the importance of relative complaint severity across domains and, clinically, call for developing self-assessment questionnaires asking specific questions about multiple cognitive functions."

        "abstract": "A cross-diagnostic, post-hoc analysis of the BRIDGE-II-MIX study was performed to investigate how unipolar and bipolar patients suffering from an acute major depressive episode (MDE) cluster according to severity and duration. Duration of index episode, Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Version-Depression (CGI-BP-D) and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) were used as clustering variables. MANOVA and post-hoc ANOVAs examined between-group differences in clustering variables. A stepwise backward regression model explored the relationship with the 56 clinical-demographic variables available. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering with two clusters was shown as the best fit and separated the study population (n = 2314) into 65.73% (Cluster 1 (C1)) and 34.26% (Cluster 2 (C2)). MANOVA showed a significant main effect for cluster group (p < 0.001) but ANOVA revealed that significant between-group differences were restricted to CGI-BP-D (p < 0.001) and GAF (p < 0.001), showing greater severity in C2. Psychotic features and a minimum of three DSM-5 criteria for mixed features (DSM-5-3C) had the strongest association with C2, that with greater disease burden, while non-mixed depression in bipolar disorder (BD) type II had negative association. Mixed affect defined as DSM-5-3C associates with greater acute severity and overall impairment, independently of the diagnosis of bipolar or unipolar depression. In this study a pure, non-mixed depression in BD type II significantly associates with lesser burden of clinical and functional severity. The lack of association for less restrictive, researched-based definitions of mixed features underlines DSM-5-3C specificity. If confirmed in further prospective studies, these findings would warrant major revisions of treatment algorithms for both unipolar and bipolar depression."

Society has transformed, as have training requirements and patient expectations, underlining an urgent need to look at educational programmes. Meanwhile, awareness has grown around psychiatric disorders and there are evolving workforce trends, with more women going to medical school and specialising in psychiatry. Trainee psychiatrists carry different expectations for work-life balance and are increasingly becoming conscious of their own mental health. A tendency to see health as a commodity and the litigious nature of society has elicited additional pressures for healthcare professionals. Cartesian mind-body dualism has created further complexity and this can often be frustrating for patients and care-partners alike. In many cultures across Asia and beyond, patients can present with physical symptoms to express underlying psychological distress with increasing physical investigations. Simultaneously, in various countries, a shift from asylums to community-based interventions and then home treatments have changed psychiatric care in remarkable ways. These changes have added to pressures faced by mental healthcare professionals. However, trainees and other mental healthcare professionals continue to receive similar training as they did a generation ago. The tensions and differences in ideology/orientation between different branches of psychiatry have made responses to patient needs challenging. Recognising that it is difficult to predict the future, this World Psychiatric Association-Asian Journal of Psychiatry Commission makes recommendations that could help institutions and individuals enhance psychiatric education. This Commission draws from existing resources and recent developments to propose a training framework for future psychiatrists."

Seventy-four in-patients (19.6±2.3 years old), who were hospitalized for the first time in the clinic for a depressive episode, were examined. Psychometric scales HDRS, SOPS, SANS were used. The risk of manifestation of psychotic disorders was established in the presence of attenuated positive symptoms (APS) with values of at least one of the points P1, P2, P3 and P4 of the corresponding SOPS subscale more or equal to 3. The overall risk of schizophrenia spectrum disorders was established in the presence of attenuated negative symptoms (ANS) with values of at least one of the points H1-H6 of the negative SOPS subscale is more than or equal to 5. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Statistica 12 program. During the psychometric assessment of patients at admission, four groups were identified based on the presence of APS and ANS: group 1 (APS+ANS), group 2 (APS), group 3 (ANS) and a comparison group without APS/ANS. It was found that the presence of APS and ANS in the structure of depression increased its severity (<i>U</i>=109.0; <i>p</i>=0.009). Assessment of the ANS severity on the negative subscale of SOPS and on the SANS demonstrated quantitative differences with the highest representation of negative symptoms in the corresponding groups (APS+ANS and ANS) with significant differences in total scores in the comparison group (<i>U</i>=93.0; <i>p</i>=0.004 and <i>U</i>=85.0; <i>p</i>=0.002).

However, today there is not enough scientific evidence on the features of development of nonpsychotic mental disorders in parents raising children with cerebral palsy and on the possibilities of using modern physiotherapy methods to correct these conditions and comorbidities. Considering that sanatorium-resort rehabilitation in children with cerebral palsy is accompanied by their parents, it is urgent to optimize clinical and functional approaches to treating mothers with borderline mental disorders with the simultaneous rehabilitation of children in sanatorium-resort conditions. To study the efficiency of sanatorium-resort treatment aimed at the psychological correction of mothers accompanying children with cerebral palsy to a sanatorium. The study enrolled 151 mothers who had borderline mental disorders and raised children with cerebral palsy. A study group included 103 women aged 33.2±0.6 years; a comparison group consisted of 48 mothers aged 31.8±0.5 years. The examination was conducted before sanatorium-resort treatment and after a therapy cycle. The mothers underwent clinical and psychodiagnostic examinations via the standardized Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (a short form) MMPI-mini (adapted by L.N. Sobchik, 2000); emotional and motivational sphere study the WAM (well-being, activity, mood) questionnaire, the Spielberger-Khanin Inventory, and the Depression Rating Scale (adapted by T.I. Balashova). The patients of both groups received combination treatment: the comparison group (n=48) had a general sanatorium-resort therapeutic complex and group psychotherapy; the study group (n=103) additionally took valerian-bromine baths based on sodium chloride water with a mineralization of 20 g/dm<sup>3</sup>), and a transcranial magnetic therapy cycle. The general sanatorium-and-resort complex with psychotherapy predominantly affected the quality of night sleep (p<0.01) and reduced personality disorders according to the hypochondria scale (from 74.60±7.52 to 52.91±4.04 scores, p<0.01). The additional use of transcranial magnetic therapy and valerian-bromine baths based on sodium chloride water in the mothers had a psychocorrecting effect recorded according to basic (hysteria, psychopathy, psychasthenia) scales. Reduced depression was noted in 36.4% of the mothers (7% in the comparison group). Transcranial magnetic therapy used in combination with valerian-bromine baths based on sodium chloride water and with psychotherapy in mothers with borderline mental disorders, by taking into account psychological dysregulation, contributed to increases in the body's clinical and functional reserves within 6-8 months and to the preservation of psychological adaptation in 54.7% of cases. Incorporation of a maternal psychocorrective complex into the sanatorium-resort treatment of a child with cerebral palsy is a promising method for improving the quality of treatment outcomes in a sanatorium."

Materials and methods: We used statistical observation, consolidation and grouping of materials of statistical observation, method of absolute and relative values. Review: In our country, mental disorders in emergency situations began to be studied especially intensively after the Chernobyl disaster. A considerable amount of research is devoted to this issue. Neuropsychiatric and psychoneurological disorders were analyzed carefully and it was established that in those people who were in the enhanced radiation zone, mental maladaptation arose due to psychological traumas, but not because of ionizing radiation. Conclusions: Art therapy turned out to be a popular activity for improving well-being, where the demobilized could do handmade work. Another good way to improve their mood was watching movies with a certain idea, sense. The most influential therapy is relaxation sessions, where the warriors can abstract their mind from everything and enjoy good music or landscapes. Among the group sessions, the \"road to peace\" theme was the most popular one, where veterans could communicate with a psychologist, express their thoughts and feelings, and, if necessary, consult for the future."

However, the mechanisms whereby the same genetic risk factors could affect the physiology of glial cells remain poorly understood. We studied the role of a psychiatric genetic risk factor, Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1), in metabolic functions of astrocytes. We evaluated the effects of knockdown of mouse endogenous DISC1 (DISC1-KD) and expression of a dominant-negative, C-terminus truncated human DISC1 (DN-DISC1) on the markers of energy metabolism, including glucose uptake and lactate production, in primary astrocytes and in mice with selective expression of DN-DISC1 in astrocytes. We also assessed the effects of lactate treatment on altered affective behaviors and impaired spatial memory in DN-DISC1 mice. Both DISC1-KD and DN-DISC1 comparably decreased mRNA and protein levels of glucose transporter 4 and glucose uptake by primary astrocytes. Decreased glucose uptake was associated with reduced oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis as well as diminished lactate production in vitro and in vivo. No significant effects of DISC1 manipulations in astrocytes were observed on expression of the subunits of the electron transport chain complexes or mitofilin, a neuronal DISC1 partner. Lactate treatment rescued the abnormal behaviors in DN-DISC1 male and female mice. Our results suggest that DISC1 may be involved in the regulation of lactate production in astrocytes to support neuronal activity and associated behaviors. Abnormal expression of DISC1 in astrocytes and resulting abnormalities in energy supply may be responsible for aspects of mood and cognitive disorders observed in patients with major psychiatric illnesses."

However, there is, to date, no classification that has resulted from a consensus established by psychodermatology experts. The DSM-5-TR (Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.), Text Revision) and the ICD-11 (International classification of diseases (11th revision)) also do not provide a systematized approach of psychodermatology disorders. Taking into consideration that classifications are a key pillar for a comprehensive approach to the pathologies of each branch of medicine, the proposal of a classification in psychodermatology appeared as a central need for the recognition of psychodermatological disorders, in an attempt to improve their recognition and, in that sense, to find a common language for the development of this subspecialty that crosses dermatology and psychiatry. Previously published classifications in psychodermatology were critically reviewed and discussed by expert opinion from an international multidisciplinary panel of 16 experts in psychodermatology and a new classification system is proposed, considering classical concepts in general dermatology and psychopathology. Two main categories of disorders are presented (a main group related to primary mental health disorders and another main group related to primary skin disorders), which are subsequently subdivided into subgroups considering pathophysiological and phenomenological similarities, including key aspects of dermatological examination, namely the presence of visible skin lesions (primary and secondary skin lesions) and psychopathological correlates. This new classification aims to unify previous classifications, systematize the disorders that belong to psychodermatology and highlight their tenuous boundaries, to improve their management. It has been built and approved by the Psychodermatology Task Force of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV), the European Society for Dermatology and Psychiatry (ESDaP) and the Association for Psychoneurocutaneous Medicine of North America (APMNA)."

However, much less is known about their occurrence in young offenders. To address this deficit, the current study examined PLEs and their associated features in a sample of young offenders in Russia. A semi-structured psychiatric interview (the K-SADS-PL) and self-reports were used to assess the prevalence of PLEs, psychopathology and personality traits in 370 incarcerated male young offenders (Mean age=16.4 (SD=0.9)). Chi-square tests and independent samples t-tests were employed to assess mental health problems and compare personality traits in adolescents with and without PLEs. We found that adolescents with lifetime HE (n= 94, 25.4%) and DB (n= 67, 18.1%) differed from their non-PLE counterparts in terms of having higher rates of major depression, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance dependence and scored higher on social and attention problems, aggressive and self-destructive behavior and externalizing problems. Adolescents with lifetime DB scored higher on novelty seeking and self-transcendence, and lower on self-directedness. We also found that adolescents with HE reported a similar personality pattern, but the difference in novelty seeking was not significant. Study findings demonstrate that PLEs are common in young offenders and are associated with an increased prevalence of other mental health problems and with certain personality traits. These findings suggest there is a need for effective screening and assessment procedures to enable timely identification and potential interventions for PLEs in incarcerated youth."

The model of institutional environment of rehabilitation of disabled children was developed including system of formal (state, legislative acts, health institutions, organizations of social support of population)and non-formal (public, non-commercial and social psychological organizations) institutions impacted by economic, social,legal and demographic factors. The role of physician is substantiated concerning increasing of quality of rehabilitation services: diagnostic of disordered functions, detection of optimal volume of medical, psychological and pedagogue activities in patients with severe speech disorders, motoric and and neuro-censorial disorders developed as a result of early organic damage of brain, neuro-infections, strokes, and other affection of brain. The adequate curative rehabilitative complex programs were developed of social everyday and social labor rehabilitation."

        "abstract": "Diffusion parameters of brain tracts (n=18) were studied in 27 men with ultra-high risk of endogenous attack-like psychoses and 27 mentally healthy men of the same age group (fractional anisotropy; and average, radial, and axial diffusion). Correlation analysis was performed between these parameters and severity of mental disorders (SOPS scale). The indexes of radial diffusion and axial diffusion were shown to change in the left anterior thalamic radiation and right posterior cingulum bundle, respectively. Our results are consistent with published data that disturbances in the frontal and temporal lobes play an important role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The degree of mental disorders correlated with diffusion parameters in the left and right anterior cingulum bundle."

Seventy-four patients with the verified diagnosis of schizophrenia and SSD (ICD-10 items F20, F21) were studied. The clinical, psychometric (BFCRS, SANS) and statistical methods were used. Clinical and psychometric study of seizures of periodic catatonia was carried out at the following stages: 1) manifestation of a seizure; 2) the maximum severity of psychopathological disorders. Also, at the end of the seizure, an additional assessment of the severity of negative symptoms was carried out using the SANS. Three forms of periodic catatonia have been identified: hypokinetic, parakinetic, multikinetic. Clinical distinguishing indicators of periodic catatonia seizurs have been established (protracted - two-stage - form of seizures; the phenomenon of «secondary catatonia»). The psychometric study revealed significant differences between the variants of periodic catatonia seizures in terms of the severity of motor phenomena (at both stages of the seizure) and negative disorders. BFCRS scores at the first stage of seizures were as follows: hypokinetic - 9.7±0.4; parakinetic - 12.8±0.9; multikinetic - 32.3±1.6 (the differences were found between 1 and 2 (<i>p</i><0.05); between 1 and 3, as well as 2 and 3 (<i>p</i><0.01)). BFCRS scores at the second stage of seizures were 12.1±0.8; 19.9±1.2 and 47.7±1.9, respectively,with the differences between 1 and 2 (<i>p</i><0.05); between 1 and 3, and also 2 and 3 (<i>p</i><0.01). The scores on the SANS anhedonia-asociality subscale were 1.9±0.2 for hypokinetic; 2.3±0.3 for parakinetic and 3.2±0.2 for multikinetic with the differences between 1 and 2, 1 and 3, 2 and 3 (<i>p</i><0.01). Periodic catatonia is the clinical entity that includes a complex of progressively worsening seizures, the psychopathological systematics of which takes into account the clinical structure of motor disorders, their affiliations with positive and negative dimensions, and functional activity."

Clinical trials revealed new facts that allowed to expand the scope of the indications for use formulated in the \"Farmakhim\" recommendations. It was found that Adepren could be used with success (in addition to the indications suggested by \"Farmakhim\") in the treatment of patients with depressive-paranoid paroxysms of periodic schizophrenia taking its course in the presence of general depression, as well as patients with somatogenic lingering astheno-depressive states. The therapeutic efficacy of didepil (an antiepileptic) was found to be in a direct relationship with the disease duration, character of the attacks, presence or absence of epileptic chandes of personality. The effect was the best in cases of a short duration of the disease and absence of gross epileptic personality changes, when the paroxysmal disorders were confined mostly to grand mals. A new scheme for arresting the epileptic status with didepil solution is offered. For the first time the efficacy of tempalgin in the treatment of patients suffering from alcoholic abstinence syndrome was substantiated. Optimal doses of the drugs have been determined with regard to the disease nosology and the leading syndrome. Contraindications to the use of the drugs have also been formulated."

        "abstract": "The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD) has been broadly incorporated into national frameworks for compulsory psychiatric treatment. Recently, instructions issued by the UN CRPD Committee discouraged any involuntary treatment and detention of people with mental disabilities, which has sparked clinical, legal, and ethical debates. Early-career psychiatrists (ECPs) are often at the front line of decisions to involuntarily detain psychiatric patients; here, the authors surveyed ECPs to gain insight into their experiences with compulsory psychiatric treatment in clinical practice. An anonymous, voluntary, online survey among ECPs from 43 countries was conducted between July and August 2019. In total, 142 ECPs completed and were eligible to participate in the survey. Most of the survey respondents reported being involved in the practice of compulsory psychiatric care. More than half reported difficulties in providing compulsory psychiatric care, mostly because of the bureaucracy of legal procedures (e.g., legal correspondence with the court) and ethical issues around detention. Most respondents (96%) generally agreed with their country's legal mechanism for compulsory treatment; 43% indicated that it should remain unchanged, and 53% indicated that it should be revised. These findings call for a broader discussion in society and among psychiatrists regarding the practice of compulsory treatment while giving due consideration to the legal, therapeutic, and ethical issues involved. The views of ECPs will be helpful in future revisions of the ethical and operational frameworks of compulsory psychiatric care."

Thirteen patients with religious delusion of possession were examined in 1994-2016 by psychopathological and follow-up methods. Hallucinations of a general feeling are the crucial psychopathological phenomenon of states with religious delusion of possession. Other delusional disorders (delusion of possession itself or metamorphosis - 'reincarnation in a demon', delusions of spoilage, witchcraft or hypochondriacal delusion) and delusional behavior (special forms of defense), haptic, olfactory hallucinations, and affective (depressive) disorders, suicidal activity are connected with this phenomena. Disease course is either continuous or attack-like. The type of disease course in most cases is complied with the development of stereotype of paranoid schizophrenia. A characteristic feature of disease was the combination of psychopathological disorders, reflecting the continuous nature of the endogenous disease (interpretive delusions, overvalued religious constructions) with disorders, that are more representative for the paroxysmal course (the phenomena of acute sensual delusions, expressed affective disorders), at the manifest stage of the disease. However, in most cases, unlike the classical hallucinatory type of paranoid schizophrenia, the disease began with circular bipolar affective disorders. In most cases, outcome of a manifesting psychosis is unfavorable."

With the founding of the Institute of Psychiatry of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences under the leadership of V.A. Gilyarovsky, the study of endogenous diseases was based on a multidisciplinary approach, in which the clinical-psychopathological research method was combined with clinical/biological ones. The most important role of the subsequent school of A.V. Snezhnevsky in describing the syndromes and forms of the course of schizophrenia (G.A. Rotshtein, R.A. Nadzharov, A.B. Smulevich, A.K. Anufriev), its age aspects (E.Ya. Sternberg; M.S. Vrono, G.P. Panteleeva, M.Ya. Tsutsulkovskaya; V.M. Bashina) is reflected. The contribution to psychopathology of other leading Russian psychiatrists, who worked mainly in Moscow and Leningrad research institutions of that period, was noted: students of P.B. Gannushkin - O.V. Kerbikov, V.M. Morozov, D.S. Ozeretskovsky, S.G. Zhislin, as well as G.K. Ushakov, A.E. Lichko, M.M. Kabanov, G.V. Morozov, M.V. Korkina, A.A. Portnov, I.N. Pyatnitskaya and others. The priority of A.V. Snezhnevsky and G.K. Avrutsky with colleagues for the introduction of neuroleptics and other new psychotropic drugs in the treatment of mental illnesses is emphasized. The review ends with the activities of M.E. Vartanyan who headed the country's leading scientific institution in the difficult «perestroika» era and developed the biological approach to mental illness further with the creation of international research programs."

Among patients with SLE a high frequency of anxiety-depressive spectrum disorders (ADSD) and cognitive impairment (CI) was revealed. There was an association of greater severity of depression with high SLE activity index, acute/subacute onset of the disease course according to the classification of V.A. Nasonova, relapsing-remitting and chronic active current disease activity patterns of SLE according to the classification of S. Barr - M. Petri. Anxiety disorders were associated with subacute onset and relapsing-remitting disease activity patterns of SLE and were not associated with SLE activity index. Bipolar disorder was detected more often in patients with chronic SLE. Acute psychosis/delirium was associated with acute onset of SLE. Organic CI was associated with APS, chronic onset and long quiescent disease activity patterns of SLE. The episindrome and schizotypal disorder in patients with SLE are more often caused by concomitant APS. Patients with high SLE activity index should be of particular concern to rheumatologists regarding the diagnosis of depressive disorders. Patients with concomitant APS need timely diagnosis and treatment of CI and episindrome in order to improve the prognosis of the disease and the overall quality of life."

At Visit 1, complaints and medical history were collected, vital signs were recorded, cognitive impairment was assessed using MMSE and MoCA, NPI-C and CSDD were completed, and an MRI brain scan was performed. Patients were randomised into two groups: patients in group 1 received Prospekta in a dosage of 2 tablets two times a day for 24 weeks, and patients in group 2 received Placebo according to the study drug regimen. Patients in both groups had no differences in demographic and baseline clinical characteristics. Administration of Prospekta for 24 weeks reduced cognitive impairment in patients with vascular dementia compared to the placebo group. The mean MoCA score increased from 17.0±3.6 [17.1±3.6] to 20.5±4.7 [20.4±4.7] in patients treated with Prospekta, whereas it increased from 17.3±3.7 [17.3±3.8] to 19.2±4.9 [19.2±5.0] in the Placebo group. Treatment with the medication also reduced the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms as measured by the NPI-C scale. The mean score on this scale decreased from 57.0±26.7 [56.7±25.4] to 39.8±23.6 [39.8±23.5] in the Prospekta group and from 55.5±25.5 [55.3±24.4] to 42.8±27.6 [42.3±25.3] in the Placebo group.

        "abstract": "Disorders of systemic immunity and immune processes in the brain have now been shown to play an essential role in the development and progression of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, only a few works were devoted to the study of some immune parameters to objectify the diagnosis by means of machine learning. At the same time, machine learning methods have not yet been applied to a set of data fully reflecting systemic characteristics of the immune status (parameters of adaptive immunity, the level of inflammatory markers, the content of major cytokines). Considering a complex nature of immune system disorders in schizophrenia, incorporation of a broad panel of immunological data into machine learning models is promising for improving classification accuracy and identifying the parameters reflecting the immune disorders typical for the majority of patients. <b>The aim of the study</b> is to assess the possibility of using immunological parameters to objectify the diagnosis of schizophrenia applying machine learning models. We have analyzed 17 immunological parameters in 63 schizophrenia patients and 36 healthy volunteers. The parameters of humoral immunity, systemic level of the key cytokines of adaptive immunity, anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and other inflammatory markers were determined by enzyme immunoassay. Applied methods of machine learning covered the main group of approaches to supervised learning such as linear models (logistic regression), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), support vector machine (linear SVM, RBF SVM), k-nearest neighbors algorithm, Gaussian processes, naive Bayes classifier, decision trees, and ensemble models (AdaBoost, random forest, XGBoost). The importance of features for prediction from the best fold has been analyzed for the machine learning methods, which demonstrated the best quality. The most significant features were selected using 70% quantile threshold. The AdaBoost ensemble model with ROC AUC of 0.71±0.15 and average accuracy (ACC) of 0.78±0.11 has demonstrated the best quality on a 10-fold cross validation test sample. Within the frameworks of the present investigation, the AdaBoost model has shown a good quality of classification between the patients with schizophrenia and healthy volunteers (ROC AUC over 0.70) at a high stability of the results (σ less than 0.2). The most important immunological parameters have been established for differentiation between the patients and healthy volunteers: the level of some systemic inflammatory markers, activation of humoral immunity, pro-inflammatory cytokines, immunoregulatory cytokines and proteins, Th1 and Th2 immunity cytokines. It was for the first time that the possibility of differentiating schizophrenia patients from healthy volunteers was shown with the accuracy of more than 70% with the help of machine learning using only immune parameters.The results of this investigation confirm a high importance of the immune system in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia."

To assess the frequency of prescribing fluvoxamine, 195 medical histories of patients who were inpatients in the children's department of the Mental Health Research Center in 2023 were analyzed. To assess the dynamics of depression during treatment with fluvoxamine, a clinical group was formed of 12 patients aged 10 to 15 years (age 13.1±3.6 years) who received fluvoxamine for the treatment of depression with comorbid obsessive-compulsive and anxiety-phobic disorders. Clinical and psychopathological, psychometric (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - HDRS) and statistical research methods were used. In total, in 2023, fluvoxamine was received by 20% (<i>n</i>=37) of all inpatient patients of child age (from 7 to 16 years). All patients received combination therapy. The therapeutic targets were comorbid depressive, obsessive-compulsive and anxiety symptoms developing in the structure of nosologically heterogeneous states, with the dominance of schizophrenic spectrum disorders. Against the background of the use of the drug fluvoxamine for 4 weeks in the clinical group, there was a significant reduction in depressive symptoms on the HDRS. Adverse events during complex therapy were observed in 20% of patients, but were not severe, did not require discontinuation of therapy and were unreliably associated with the use of fluvoxamine. The use of the fluvoxamine provides reduction of depressive symptoms within the framework of various nosologies, and is characterized by sufficient safety. The variety of therapeutic targets of the fluvoxamine, including antidepressant, anti-anxiety, cognitive effects, is certainly a significant advantage of the studied fluvoxamine for use in childhood."

        "abstract": "Achievement of efficacy by a functional system develops subjective sensation, which is necessary to understand the quality of a body's particular system. The mechanisms responsible for positive and negative reinforcement serves this purpose. The involvement of endogenous opioids and dopamine in the telemesencephalic structures in euphoria, dysphoria, and pain is discussed. There is a similarity of the neurophysiology and neurochemistry of positive and negative reinforcements. Craving for drug abuse is associated with the action of functional systems, whose result is the most comfortable emotional state. Some specific features of impact of drug abuse on the mechanisms of positive and negative reward are indicated. It is concluded that psychoactive drug addiction and dependence develop via the natural mechanisms of reinforcement."

The tendency to transformation of the concept of «general degenerative constitution» into the concept of relatively discrete types of psychopathic personalities is delineated. The understanding of «degenerative psychopathy» as unitary predisposition to the «degenerative psychoses», inborn disharmony of character with its multivarious innumerable variants and different forms of «deficiencies», including intellectual, is experiencing transformation to the numerically limited separated types of psychopathic personalities and pathological characters related to the appropriate more pronounced psychiatric diseases.

Twenty-four patients with ASD (22 boys and 2 girls) with infantile psychosis in childhood autism (ICD-10 F84.02) were studied. The median age of the patients was 5,5 years. Neuro-immune and thrombodynamics tests were performed. Thrombodynamic parameters of clot growth rates from the activator (V, Vi and Vst) are significantly higher than their normal values. The values of the time of spontaneous clots occurrence (Tsp) are significantly less than the lower limit values for the norm (30 min). It was also shown that the activity of leukocyte elastase (LE) and the functional activity of the α1 protein inhibitor (α1-PI) are significantly higher than their normal values. The values of the levels of autoantibodies to S100 protein (aabS100B) and the basic myelin protein (aabOBM) are within the normal range. The initial clot growth rate (Vi) and the time of spontaneous clots occurrence (Tsp) significantly correlate with the severity of catatonia: Spearman's R is 0,55 for Vi (<i>p</i>=0,009) and -0,61for Tsp (<i>p</i>=0,002). Among the parameters of the neuro-immuno-test, only aabS100B indicator significantly correlates with the severity of catatonia. To increase the informative significance and accuracy of the contribution of the studied correlates of thrombodynamics and the neuro-immuno-test to the assessment of the severity of catatonia in children with ASD, a multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to construct a linear equation for the relationship between the severity of catatonia and correlates of thrombodynamics and a neuro-immuno-test. The determination coefficient R2, which determines the informational significance of the regression model, is 0,63. The remaining 37% is explained by unaccounted and not yet known factors."

Evidence is accumulating that the Sars-CoV-2 virus can induce mania or hypomania in people with no personal psychopathological history. Some clinical, anamnestic and paraclinical patterns of new-onset mania and hypomania have been found. In cases of severe manic symptoms, it is possible to quickly assume the occurrence of bipolar affective disorder. The predominance of depressive and anxiety syndromes in the long-term disease and the presence of vivid vegetative symptoms can mask brief and syndromally incomplete episodes of hypomania, which distorts the understanding of the disease as a bipolar disorder. This article presents such a clinical case of the occurrence of bipolar affective disorder in a patient who had COVID-19 with an asymptomatic course.

Control group consisted of 26 healthy volunteers. Clinical-dynamic evaluation was carried out using SIGH-SAD and SHAPS-C. Melatonin concentration was measured with MAGPIX analyzer (Luminex, USA). The statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS (V. 23.0) standard package. In the case of MD/AUD comorbidity anhedonia symptom does not respond well to psychopharmacotherapy during four weeks (<i>p</i>=0.192, Wilcoxon test) whereas anhedonia in «pure» MD does (<i>p</i>=0.007, Wilcoxon test).

The relatively low response of anhedonia symptom in the case of MD/AUD comorbidity compared with the «pure» MD, makes perspective using antidepressants with prodophaminergic mechanism of action in this cohort of patients. Furthermore, in MD/AUD comorbidity, contrary to «pure» MD, a relative increase in melatonin concentration in blood serum was detected, therefore it could be a limitation to prescribing antidepressants directly or indirectly modulating melatoninergic system."

At the present stage of studies, this position is clearly articulated in the «deficit schizophrenia» concept of J. Klosterkotter. Negative disorders are considered in categorical approach to interpret psychopathological dimensions of schizophrenia as coordinated, strongly bound with positive syndromes (concept of «dialectical unity» of A.V. Snezhnevskiy, 1964) and classified as syndromes according to systematics of positive disorders. However, distinguished types of negative disorders are determined in terms of positive syndromes or characterological changes (asthenic, pseudopsychopathic deficit). Within a new paradigm (dimensional approach to schizophrenia), which differs from the categorical approach, negative disorders are considered as a distinct domain, primary in relation to other psychopathological phenomena of schizophrenia). A concept of primary persistent negative symptoms serves as basis of the current concept of schizophrenic deficit. Factor analysis revealed two domains of negative disorders: 1) emotional blunting: blunted affect, alogia; 2) avolition: apathy, anhedonia, asociality."

Alcohol use disorders are some of the most prevalent mental disorders globally, especially in high-income and upper-middle-income countries; and are associated with high mortality and burden of disease, mainly due to medical consequences, such as liver cirrhosis or injury. Despite their high prevalence, alcohol use disorders are undertreated partly because of the high stigma associated with them, but also because of insufficient systematic screening in primary health care, although effective and cost-effective psychosocial and pharmacological interventions do exist. Primary health care should be responsible for most treatment, with routine screening for alcohol use, and the provision of a staggered treatment response, from brief advice to pharmacological treatment. Clinical interventions for these disorders should be embedded in a supportive environment, which can be bolstered by the creation of alcohol control policies aimed at reducing the overall level of consumption."

Also, a decreased size of pyramidal neurons has been detected in layer III in SCH and in mood disorders. Since oligodendrocytes have a trophic influence on neurons, reduced neuronal size reported in these disorders might be associated with the deficit in subpopulation of perineuronal oligodendrocytes. We hypothesized that deficit of perineuronal oligodendrocytes might occur in SCH and mood disorders. We estimated the number of oligodendroglial satellites of pyramidal neurons and the size of pyramidal neurons in layer III (Brodmann's area 9) in Nissl stained sections in SCH, BPD, MDD and normal controls. The Stanley Foundation Neuropathology Consortium brain collection consisted of 15 cases in each of four groups was used. We detected a prominent and significant reduction in the number of perineuronal oligodendrocytes in the sublayers IIIa, IIIb and IIIc in SCH, BPD and MDD as compared to controls. The BPD group differed significantly from SCH group and from MDD group. There were no significant differences in somal sizes of pyramidal neurons in the sublayers IIIa, IIIb, IIIc between each of the psychiatric groups and the control group. Only BPD group showed significantly smaller neuronal size in sublayer IIIc as compared to controls.

        "abstract": "To study disorders of mental development and psychopathological symptoms in young children with autistic disorders of various origins. Two hundred and sixty-five children, aged 9 months to 4 years, (201 boys, 64 girls) with symptoms of autistic disorder were examined. The patients were divided into two age groups - the 1st group consisted of 36 children, aged 9 months to 2 years, the 2nd group consisted of 229 children from 2 years to 4 years. Psychopathological, neurological and clinical-dynamic methods were used, taking into account the results of consultations with a speech therapist, defectologist, psychologist. The number of visits to a psychiatrist by parents of children older than two years becomes significantly higher - 13.6% (<i>n</i>=36) and 86.4% (<i>n</i>=112), respectively (<i>p</i>≤0.05), as well as the diagnosis of autistic disorder - 8.3% (<i>n</i>=3) and 16.2% (<i>n</i>=37) respectively, <i>p</i>≤0.05). In both age groups, the diagnosis of «Other general developmental disorders» (F84.8) was most often established, with a significant predominance in the younger group - 80.5% and 72%, respectively (<i>p</i>≤0.05). Characteristic symptoms-markers of autism for both age groups are highlighted. It is shown that the diagnoses of childhood autism, Kanner syndrome, exposed at the first treatment, were preserved in all patients after three years. By the age of four, it was possible to clarify the diagnosis in 32% of cases. At the same time, 68% of patients, aged 4 years, retained a clinically undifferentiated diagnosis of F84.8. The study showed an increase in the diagnosis of autistic disorder during the first years of life. The necessity of increasing the knowledge of early-age psychiatry among specialists and the organization of a system of early detection, timely treatment and rehabilitation of autistic disorders in children of the first years of life in children's polyclinics is noted."

It is shown how, after the recognition by the majority of psychiatrists of the concept of early dementia proposed by E. Kraepelin, there is a gradual recognition of the single essence of schizophrenia for childhood and adulthood, but with different, specific clinical manifestations at different age periods. The study of variants of schizophrenia without a fatal outcome in dementia, which led to the isolation of sluggish schizophrenia, including in childhood, begins with the works of E. Bleuler. The differences in approaches to the study and interpretation of sluggish schizophrenia in Russian, European and American psychiatry, which led to the isolation of STEs in the framework of personality disorders, are described. Three main concepts that exist at the present stage of research are presented, in which STD is considered as an independent disease in the spectrum of schizophrenic disorders, as one of the types of personality deviations with a high degree of vulnerability for the development of schizophrenia, and as one of the forms of the disease."

Probands (n=109) and their relatives were studied using the direct clinical examination; the study of 84 probands and their relatives was based on the medical records from the genetic archive of Mental Health Research Center, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. Mental pathology was found in 72,5% of relatives; 27,5% were healthy. Prevalence of endogenous and non-endogenous psychoses, personality disorders and cases of alcoholism and suicides in the families of probands was studied. A \"set\" of these psychopathologies was similar in families of all probands and their frequency was higher than that in the general population that confirmed the affiliation of SAP with endogenous diseases by genetic characteristics. In patients with SAP, hereditary characteristics differed by the frequency, correlation and preference of some types of mental pathology compared to families of patients with schizophrenia and MDP, in particular, hereditary characteristics of patients with recurrent schizophrenia and MDP which were identified with SAP by many authors. The clinical-genetic patterns revealed in the study are considered as an argument for nosological independence of SAP."

Affective symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Young's Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Cognitive impairment was assessed using the Brief Neuropsychological Cognitive Examination (BNCE). Cognitive impairment was revealed in 43.5% of the patients. The frequency and structure of cognitive impairment in patients with BD type I and type II did not differ. The patients with cognitive impairment were characterized by decreased speed of mental processes, decreased working memory and attention deficit. The correlation of the total BNCE score with the age of the patients, duration of the disease, total HDRS and YMRS scores was revealed. The results demonstrate the affective nature of cognitive deficit in the patients. Cognitive impairment in remitted patients with BD is a significant therapeutic target."

The Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) was administered to assess the severity of CI. The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale was used to assess social functioning. The structure of organic personality disorder due to epilepsy is determined by a combination of CI and personality changes with a predominance of explosive (short temper, irritability, brutality, explosiveness) or defensive (passivity, suggestibility, vulnerability, suspiciousness, sensitivity, subordination) traits. CI includes impaired thinking, attention, and memory and is manifested by inertia, stiffness, toughness, rigidity, slowing down the pace of thought processes, as well as difficulty in concentrating, impaired direct and indirect memory. Three groups of patients with mild, moderate and severe CI are isolated.

The study included 52 female adolescents, aged 10.2-16.7 years (mean age 13.1±1.9 years) who, at the time of admission, met the DSM-5 ARFID criteria. The average follow-up period was 5.6±1.6 years, the average age at the time of the last follow-up examination was 19.1±2.7 years. Patients with ARFID accounted for 8.4% of the sample of female adolescents with EDs. The stability of the clinical manifestations of ARFID indicates the validity of considering ARFID as an independent diagnostic category. The clinical picture of ARFID is determined by specific symptom complexes amalgamated with constitutional features. The latter are manifested from early childhood by neuroticism, anxiety, a weakened and somewhat perverted food instinct, metabolic features, partly determining the low need for food, immaturity and weakness of autonomic regulation that may form a predisposition for the development of psychosomatic/somatopsychic disorders. The study allows us to talk about a special predisposition, in the form of psychosomatic diathesis, which predisposes to ARFID and is a significant component of the response to psychogenic factors. It is assumed that diathesis as an abnormal constitution that determines the regulation of mental, autonomic and metabolic processes is a significant pathogenetic mechanism for other EDs. A certain commonality of the etiology and pathogenesis of ARFID and the entire group of EDs is confirmed by the high burden of family history of patients with various forms of EDs (13.5%) and a significant frequency of transformation of ARFID into other EDs."

The results of the psychopathological study (with the use of psychometric methods) of deficit disorders in a sample of 170 patients with schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (63 men, 107 women) are presented in relation to the abnormal structure of premorbid personality (PD of clusters A, B, C). An analysis of negative symptoms according to the comparability of defect to the profile of premorbid personality made it possible to distinguish three groups of deficit states associated with PD - 'common syndromes': defensive schizoidy by the type of deficit schizoid and expansive schizoidy by the type of 'verschroben' (cluster A); pathological hysterical infantilism, malignant hysteria and defective erotomania (cluster B); pseudo-psychasthenia and pathological rationalism (cluster C). It has been found that the symptomatology of 'common syndromes' is subject to patterns reflecting the dichotomy of the basic defect. This pattern is valid not only for one single cluster of PD, but extends to all psychopathy-like disorders, regardless of their affiliation with a particular cluster. The pathocharacterological component of the 'common syndromes' coexisting with the deficit symptom complexes is subject to the basic deficit component of the defect and is separated into polar dimensions (defensive-expansive) within specific clusters of PD, and then unified in accordance with the dichotomy of schizophrenic defect in categories with the predominance of emotional or apathoabulic disorders. Psychopathy-like symptom complexes in the space of 'common syndromes' can be qualified as a psychopathological construct secondary to basic deficit disorders, and their isolation as an independent entity of negative disorders appears to be unjustified."

A population-based cohort of adolescents (n = 1443, age = 15 years; 48% males) rated the frequency at which they experienced symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Conduct Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Depression, Generalized Anxiety, Social Phobia, Eating Disorders (i.e. DSM disorders), Self-harm, Delinquency, Psychopathy as well as social adaptation problems (e.g. aggression). They also rated interference with functioning in four contexts (family, friends, school, daily life). Reliability analyses indicated good to excellent internal consistency for most scales (alpha = 0.70-0.97) except Psychopathy (alpha = 0.46). The hypothesized structure of the instrument showed acceptable fit according to confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) [Chi-square (4155) = 9776.2, p = 0.000; Chi-square/DF = 2.35; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.031; Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.864], and good convergent and discriminant validity according to multitrait-multimethods analysis. This initial study showed adequate internal validity and reliability of the MIA. Our findings open the way for further studies investigating other validity aspects, which are necessary before recommending the wide use of the MIA in research and clinical settings."

The correlation and role of different factors in the formation of syndromes of higher mental functions (HMF) impairment in AD and SD were determined. The analysis was based on the concept of the presence of operational and regulatory factors in the systemic organization of mental activity. The structure of the syndrome of HMF impairment in AD is specified by the deficiency of operational factors whereas in SD, the deficiency of regulatory factors plays the key role. The patients with AD manifest the combination of disordered operational and regulatory factors related to the work of brain blocks II and I respectively (according to Luria). In SD patients, the syndrome is marked by the predominance of the symptoms related to the deficiency of regulatory factors provided for by the structures of brain blocks III and I, with the interest of the brain areas entering block II being far less."

        "abstract": "The aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview of the literature on the possible immunologic pathophysiology of psychiatric manifestations of neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE). A systematic search on PubMed was conducted. English studies with full text availability that investigated the correlation between blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, intrathecal synthesis of antibodies, antibodies, cytokines, chemokines, metalloproteinases, complement and psychiatric NPSLE manifestations in adults were included. Both transient BBB-dysfunction with consequent access of antibodies to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and intrathecal synthesis of antibodies could occur in psychiatric NPSLE. Anti-phospholipid antibodies, anti-NMDA antibodies and anti-ribosomal protein p antibodies seem to mediate concentration dependent neuronal dysfunction. Interferon-α may induce microglial engulfment of neurons, direct neuronal damage and production of cytokines and chemokines in psychiatric NPSLE. Several cytokines, chemokines and matrix metalloproteinase-9 may contribute to the pathophysiology of psychiatric NPSLE by attracting and activating Th1-cells and B-cells. This potential pathophysiology may help understand NPSLE and may have implications for the diagnostic management and therapy of psychiatric NPSLE. However, the presented pathophysiological model is based on correlations between potential immunologic etiologies and psychiatric NPSLE that remain questionable. More research on this topic is necessary to further elucidate the pathophysiology of NPSLE."

Ultrastructural signs of apoptosis and necrosis of oligodendroglial cells were found in the prefrontal area 10 and the caudate nucleus in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Damage of myelin sheath lamellae, with the formation of concentric lamellar bodies, were detected in both brain structures in schizophrenia. There was also a significant decrease in the area of the nucleus and the volume density of mitochondria in oligodendrogliocytes in the caudate nucleus and in the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia, as compared to normal controls. Volume density of heterochromatin was significantly increased (+14%) in the caudate nucleus in schizophrenia. The density of concentric lamellar bodies (as an indicator of damage of myelinated fibers) was dramatically increased (4.5-fold) in the caudate nucleus in schizophrenia, as compared to controls, and was positively correlated with volume density of heterochromatin. Multiple regression analysis and analysis of covariance demonstrated that these changes could not be explained by the effects of postmortem delay, age, neuroleptic medication, or gender. Pathology of oligodendroglia might be an essential feature of severe mental disorders."

A sample of 170 patients with paranoid schizophrenia was stratified by the presence of catatonic symptoms in the structure of psychosis (66 patients with catatonia and 104 patients without catatonia), inclusion threshold was >10 points on the Bush-Francis catatonia scale. The examination was carried out in the early days of inpatient treatment using psychopathological, psychometric and immunological methods. Quantitative and qualitative differences in the spectrum of immune indicators in both groups of patients are revealed. A higher level of the immune system activation is found in the group with catatonic symptoms that indicates a worsening of the pathological process. A specific feature of the immunological profile of catatonic syndrome in schizophrenia is a decrease in ratio between leukocyte elastase and a1-proteinase inhibitor (leukocyte-inhibitory index) accompanied by the increase of other inflammatory markers that, presumably, indicates the deterioration of the phagocyte component of the inflammatory response. The results suggest that the decrease in leukocyte-inhibitory index is a potential biomarker of catatonic syndrome in schizophrenia."

This study's objective was to estimate DDAH1 and DDAH2 associations with biological processes implicated in major psychiatric disorders using publicly accessible expression databases. Since co-expressed genes are more likely to be involved in the same biologic processes, we investigated co-expression patterns with DDAH1 and DDAH2 in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in psychiatric patients and control subjects. There were no significant differences in DDAH1 and DDAH2 expression levels in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder patients compared to controls. Meanwhile, the data suggest that in patients, DDAH1 and DDHA2 undergo a functional shift mirrored in changes in co-expressed gene patterns. This disarrangement appears in the loss of expression level correlations between DDAH1 or DDAH2 and genes associated with psychiatric disorders and reduced functional similarity of DDAH1 or DDAH2 co-expressed genes in the patient groups. Our findings evidence the possible involvement of DDAH1 and DDAH2 in neuropsychiatric disorder development, but the underlying mechanisms need experimental validation."

Dopamine receptors are not only found on cells of the innate immune response (nonspecific), but also on cells of adaptive immune response (specific): T and B lymphocytes. These facts bring a new evidence of interrelationships between the peripheral immune system, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration and suggest new ways for investigation of the pathogenesis of different mental and neurological disorders, in particular Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. There is strong evidence that ligands of dopamine receptors can change the expression of coding genes both in central neurons and in peripheral cells. Thus, peripheral blood lymphocytes may prove a cellular tool to identify dopamine transmission disturbances in neuropsychiatric diseases, as well as to monitor the effects of pharmacological treatment."

Fear of illness, self-isolation/quarantine, and decreased quality of life have dramatically increased the level of stress-related disorders in the population. The main mental disorders arising from stress refer to anxiety disorders (post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder), obsessive-compulsive disorder, depressions of varying severity and conversion reactions. The symptoms and early warning signs of stress-related disorders may be chronic or episodic. Stress-related disorders are corrected with psychotropic therapy, which aims to restore the balance of neurotransmitters. Current first choice agents for the treatment of both pathological anxiety and depression are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). During the pandemic, the SSRI fluvoxamine is of special interest. Its mechanisms of action are recognized as potentially useful for treating COVID-19 infection.

        "abstract": "The paper presents data on 38 patients with slow-progredient schizophrenia and cyclothymia with clinical picture of social phobias combined with sensitive ideas of reference. Two types of such states were singled out: social phobia of self-insufficiency with isolated sensitive ideas of reference (13 patients) and social phobia with the ideas of physical or mental defect and generalized ideas of reference (25 cases). The states of the first type were observed in the structure of circular melancholic depressions and were characterised by the presence of the ideas of low self-esteem. Phobic avoidance is low expressed, sensitive ideas of the reference are fragmental and transitory. Social adaptation was not, as a rule, changed in such cases or was changed insignificantly. The states of the second type were registered at simple and psychopathic-like variations of slow-progredient schizophrenia and were characterized by generalized anxiety in all situations concerning appearance in public. The contents of social phobia is a supposition of a physic or mental defect. The peculiarities of the states of this type are the presence of generalized sensitive ideas of reference, total avoidance and lack of the connection between anxious-phobic symptomatology and manifestations of comorbid affective disorders in the form of prolonged depressions of dysthymic level. The course of the disease is chronic, without remissions. Prognosis of social phobia of the second type is unfavourable."

Convexital contusions (pathoanatomically-chiefly cortical or cortico-subcortical) ran the most favourable course and were characterized by distinct focal symptoms prevailing over slight, in most cases, general cerebral disturbances. Polarobasal contusions (anatomically - extensive or massive, i.e. penetrating down to subcortical ganglia or the lateral ventricles) ran a grave course and were characterized by progressing focal hemispheric symptoms in the presence of undulating development of general cerebral disturbances. Diffuse contusions of the brain hemispheres (anatomically small foci of destruction and hemorrhages in the cortex and the paraventricular divisions of the white matter) were characterized by prevalence of marked general cerebral disturbances over slight scattered focal symptoms."

        "abstract": "Abnormality of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor (D<sub>2</sub>R) function, often observed as D<sub>2</sub>R supersensitivity (D<sub>2</sub>RSS), is a commonality of schizophrenia and related psychiatric disorders in humans. Moreover, virtually all psychotherapeutic agents for schizophrenia target D<sub>2</sub>R in brain. Permanent D<sub>2</sub>RSS as a feature of a new animal model of schizophrenia was first reported in 1991, and then behaviorally and biochemically characterized over the next 15-20 years. In this model of schizophrenia characterized by production of D<sub>2</sub>RSS in ontogeny, there are demonstrated alterations of signaling processes, as well as functional links between the biologic template of the animal model and ability of pharmacotherapeutics to modulate or reverse biologic and behavioral modalities toward normality. Another such animal model, featuring knockout of trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), demonstrates D<sub>2</sub>RSS with an increase in the proportion of D<sub>2</sub>R in the high-affinity state. Currently, TAAR1 agonists are being explored as a therapeutic option for schizophrenia. There is likewise an overlay of D<sub>2</sub>RSS with substance use disorder. The aspect of adenosine A<sub>2A</sub>-D<sub>2</sub> heteroreceptor complexes in substance use disorder is highlighted, and the association of adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonists in discriminative and rewarding effects of psychostimulants is outlined. In summary, these new animal models of schizophrenia have face, construct, and predictive validity, and distinct advantages over earlier models. While the review summarizes elements of D<sub>2</sub>RSS in schizophrenia per se, and its interplay with substance use disorder, a major focus is on presumed new molecular targets attending D<sub>2</sub>RSS in schizophrenia and related clinical entities."

The article discusses the prospects for using the calcium channel blocker nimodipine as a method of both mono and combination therapy for bipolar disorders with various types of course. Nimodipine is a selective blocker of voltage-dependent calcium channels, a dihydropyridine derivative. By blocking L type calcium channels, it prevents the entry of calcium ions into the cell. Due to its pronounced ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, it has a selective effect on brain neurons and has a vasodilating, antihypertensive and normotimic effect. Nimodipine blocks LTCC channels in brain neurons, thereby influencing synaptic plasticity, transmitter release and excitation-transcription coupling, which makes it possible to influence various clinical conditions with pathology in the area of affect, including bipolar disorders with ultra-rapid cycling, and also, in cases with high resistance and intolerance to other mood stabilizers."

Sample 1 included 66 people, aged 19-55 years, without diagnosed sleep disturbances who completed the Scale of Behavioral Factors of Sleep Disturbances (subscales for Taking Medications and Non-Medications, Alcohol, Tonic Drinks and Using Gadgets in the evening, Delaying Bedtime, Self-Limitations, Sleep Ritual, Adherence to the Regimen, Postponement of the Morning Rise), Insomnia Severity Index, Hospital Scale of Anxiety and Depression. Sample 2 included 174 people, aged 17-57 years, without diagnosed sleep disorders, who completed Beck's Anxiety and Depression Inventories in addition to the scales administered to sample 1. Forty-four people completed the Scale of Behavioral Factors again after two weeks. The moderate reliability-consistency (α=0.62-0.93) and retest reliability of the subscales (<i>r</i>=0.33-0.79, <i>p</i><0.01) as well as the relationship between poor sleep, especially in the evening, self-limitating behavior and sleep-related complaints of sleep, anxiety and, to a lesser extent, complaints of depressive symptoms (<i>r</i>=0.15-0.58<i>, p</i><0.05) were revealed. All behavioral strategies, except for the sleep ritual, are characterized by an indirect effect on anxiety, depressiveness, poor well-being (|β|=0.03-0.24): the more often a person uses them, the more likely he/she has sleep-related complaints, which, in turn, is a risk factor for poorer well-being. Self-limiting behavior and delaying the morning rise are associated with a lower level of well-being, even in the absence of sleep-related complaints (β=0.23-0.34, <i>p</i><0.01). The Scale of Behavioral Factors of Sleep Disturbances can be used for research purposes. The results of the study suggest that the dysfunctional role of behavior on well-being is predominantly indirect (through the perpetuation of complaints), but it can also be direct (regardless of complaints of sleep disorders)."

To study the severity and risk factors of KP in patients requiring total hip and knee endoprosthetics (EP). We examined 50 patients requiring total EP of the hip and knee joints. Pain syndrome was assessed in the preoperative and early postoperative periods in all patients using a visual analog scale, as well as the levels of kinesiophobia, anxiety, and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK). Quality of patients life was studied in the preoperative period (RAND SF36 questionnaire). In the majority of cases, both before and after EP, the level of KP corresponded to an average degree of severity. Both in the preoperative and in the early postoperative periods, not a single case of the absence of KP was detected (≤17 points according to the TSK); at the same time, a very high level of KP (≥55 points according to TSK) was also rarely recorded - in 3 patients in the postoperative period after EP of the hip joint. KP level significantly correlated with the duration of the pain syndrome, while the mental component of the KP, in addition to the duration of the pain syndrome, was influenced by the social status: in patients who had a steady job, the psychological component of the KP was expressed in a less degree. KP level was negatively correlated with such indicators of quality of life as vitality and physical functioning. In addition, the physical component of the KP significantly correlated with the pain intensity, the mental component - with role-playing behavior. Early detection of KP and timely correction of distorted ideas about physical activity are necessary for successful rehabilitation of patients requiring total joint endoprosthetics of the lower limb."

Sixty-eight women with depressive states in schizophrenia and 23 mentally and somatically healthy age- and sex-matched people were examined. The clinical condition of the patients was assessed by the total PANSS (PANSS_tot) and HDRS (HDRS_tot) scores. PAM was determined in the peripheral blood of patients and healthy controls by counting the number of large monocytes with a diameter of 12.5 to 15 microns on a cell counter and analyzer using the positive magnetic separation method to isolate a pure population of CD14 monocytes. Before treatment, the level of PAM significantly exceeded the corresponding value in controls (<i>p</i><0.001) in half of the patients; after treatment, the level of PAM decreased to control values (<i>p</i><0.001). Linear regression revealed in a subgroup of patients with an initially low PAM level a positive correlation between its value and HDRS tot (<i>r</i>=0.5, <i>p</i><0.05) before treatment, that is, a low PAM level before treatment was accompanied by low-severity depressive disorders. The analysis of PAM level in the subgroups of patients responding and not responding to treatment revealed a decrease in the PAM value after treatment in the responding patients assessed by PANSS_tot (<i>p</i><0.05) and in the responding patients assessed by HDRS_tot (<i>p</i>=0.06). Similar patterns were not detected in the subgroups of nonresponders. The correlations between the PAM level and the severity of depressive and other psychopathological disorders in patients with depressive states in schizophrenia may indicate the involvement of immune inflammation in the pathogenesis of this disease. The positive relationship between the initially low PAM level and the mild severity of depressive disorders can be used as a prognostic sign of patients' response to treatment."

The data on 728 patients with psychoautonomic syndrome (91.6% of the total sample) were available for statistical analysis. All patients suffered from asthenic disorders. The duration of treatment with ladasten in daily dose from 50 to 100 mg was 28 days. Patient's state was assessed with psychometric scales at baseline, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days of therapy and one month after the end of treatment. The percentage of responders was 76.0% on the CGI-S and 90.8% on the CGI-I. The antiasthenic effect of ladasten was seen on day 3 and remained during one month after the withdrawal of therapy. We determined clinical efficacy of ladasten in regard to anxiety-depressive spectrum disorders, autonomic dystonia, sleep disorders. Ladasten therapy led to the significant increase of quality of life, which was seen not only after the end of therapy, but after the withdrawal of the drug. These results suggest the stability of the therapeutic effect achieved. Adverse effects were observed only in 3% of patients, the therapy was discontinued in 0.8%. No serious adverse effects were found. In conclusion, the efficacy of ladasten was shown in its antiasthenic, anxyolytic, autonomic nervous system stabilizing properties, the normalization of sleep-awake cycle and the increase of quality of life. Ladasten in daily dose from 50 to 100 mg is a highly effective, well-tolerated and safety drug with a wide spectrum of clinical effects. Therefore, this drug could be recommended for treatment of asthenic disorders in neurological practice."

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing mental health-related stigma among PHC professionals (general practitioners, nurses, community health workers, and allied providers). Eligibility was restricted to interventional studies targeting PHC staff; non-clinical populations and students without clinical practice were excluded. Comparators included usual training, waitlist control, or pre-post evaluation. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251074412). Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria, of which three contributed to the quantitative synthesis. Interventions included educational, contact-based, and multicomponent approaches. Risk of bias was assessed using tools appropriate to study design. Interventions generally improved knowledge and attitudes and, to a lesser extent, behavioral intentions. Meta-analysis of pre-post changes using the Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC) demonstrated a significant reduction in stigma (MD = -0.27, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.14; <i>p</i> < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 91%). A difference-in-differences analysis of studies with intervention and control groups confirmed this effect with moderate heterogeneity (MD = -0.18, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.11; <i>p</i> < 0.0001; I<sup>2</sup> = 50%). Contact-based and multicomponent interventions were associated with stronger and more sustained effects. The main limitations of the evidence were short follow-up periods, reliance on self-reported outcomes, methodological heterogeneity, and the possibility of publication bias. Our findings suggest that reducing stigma among PHC professionals can enhance patient engagement, timely diagnosis, and quality of care in routine clinical practice."

The present narrative review aims to provide an elaborate description of the bio-psycho-social facets of refractory functional gastrointestinal disorders, psychiatrists' role, specific psychiatric approach, and the latest psychiatric and psychological perspectives on practical therapeutic management. In this respect, \"psyche,\" \"psychiatry,\" \"psychology,\" \"psychiatrist,\" \"psychotropic,\" and \"refractory functional gastrointestinal disorders\" (as the keywords) were searched in relevant English publications from January 1, 1950, to March 1, 2024, in the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases. Eventually, the narrative technique was adopted to reach a compelling story with a high level of cohesion through material synthesis. The current literature recognizes the brain-gut axis modulation as a therapeutic target for refractory functional gastrointestinal disorders and the bio-psycho-social model as an integrated framework to explain disease pathogenesis. The results also reveal some evidence to affirm the benefits of psychotropic medications and psychological therapies in refractory functional gastrointestinal disorders, even when psychiatric symptoms were absent. It seems that psychiatrists are required to pay higher levels of attention to both the assessment and treatment of patients with refractory functional gastrointestinal disorders, accompanied by educating and training practitioners who take care of these patients."

        "abstract": "Most mental health services for trauma-exposed children and adolescents were not originally developed for refugees. Information is needed to help clinicians design services to address the consequences of trauma in refugee populations. We compared trauma exposure, psychological distress, and mental health service utilization among children and adolescents of refugee-origin, immigrant-origin, and U.S.-origin referred for assessment and treatment by U.S. providers in the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN). We used propensity score matching to compare trauma profiles, mental health needs, and service use across three groups. Our sample comprised refugee-origin youth (n = 60, 48.3% female, mean age = 13.07 years) and propensity-matched samples of immigrant-origin youth (n = 143, 60.8% female, mean age = 13.26 years), and U.S.-origin youth (n = 140, 56.1% female, mean age = 12.11 years). On average, there were significantly more types of trauma exposure among refugee youth than either U.S.-origin youth (p < .001) or immigrant youth (p ≤ .001). Compared with U.S.-origin youth, refugee youth had higher rates of community violence exposure, dissociative symptoms, traumatic grief, somatization, and phobic disorder.  In contrast, the refugee group had comparably lower rates of substance abuse and oppositional defiant disorder (ps ranging from .030 to < .001).This clinic-referred sample of refugee-origin youth presented with distinct patterns of trauma exposure, distress symptoms, and service needs that merit consideration in services planning."

        "abstract": "Natural and man-made disasters carry with them major burden and very often the focus is on immediate survival and management of resulting infectious diseases. The impact of disasters directly and indirectly on the well-being and mental health of those affected often gets ignored. The reasons are often stigma and lack of attention to mental health consequences. In addition, often the focus is on preventing the spread of infectious diseases such as waterborne or airborne diseases. This is further complicated by the fact that often aid agencies in offering aid tend to focus on communicable diseases and not on mental health of populations. This focus may reflect easily to measure outcomes in comparison with mental illnesses as the global burden of disease is likely to increase in the next few decades. There is an urgent need to apply the principles of social justice on social and health care policies, which will lead to elimination of stigma. In this article, we propose that the impact of mental illness as a result of disasters needs to be taken seriously in any planning and delivery of relief. Mental health is likely to be affected both directly and indirectly as a result of disasters and also likely to be influenced by ongoing factors such as poor housing, overcrowding and other social determinants. In addition to deliver equity between physical and mental illnesses, appropriate and adequate resources are needed so that identifiable needs can be met with clear outcomes."

        "abstract": "The paper considers the phenomenon of «mental atony» in children with developmental delay, intellectual disability and autism. The condition of mental atony is a congenital or early acquired even decrease in mental tone, manifested by the reduced ability to concentrate attention, a decline of the targeted activity, difficulties in contacting, weakening of unconditioned reflexes, lack of instinctive manifestations, «mobilization» of mental functions by persistent verbal and tactile stimulation. The article provides the history of the «mental atony» theory, as well as clinical features, epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis and nosological specificity of the condition. Moreover, the criteria for the differential diagnosis between the atonic form of intellectual disability and autism are discussed in detail. Based on the analysis of literature and the results of own clinical observations, the authors conclude that a thorough differential analysis between childhood autism and atonic form of intellectual disability in children is necessary, otherwise, there is a risk of overdiagnosis of autistic disorders. The authors also point to the role of the brain lesion, particularly in the area of reticular formation, in the occurrence of phenomena of mental atony."

The current study aimed to investigate multi-comorbidity in patients with psychiatric disorders in comparison to the general population. Secondary aims were to investigate factors associated with metabolic syndrome and treatment appropriateness of mental disorders. The sample included 54,826 subjects (64.73% females; 34.15% males; 1.11% nonbinary gender) from 40 countries (COMET-G study). The analysis was based on the registration of previous history that could serve as a fair approximation for the lifetime prevalence of various medical conditions. About 24.5% reported a history of somatic and 26.14% of mental disorders. Mental disorders were by far the most prevalent group of medical conditions. Comorbidity of any somatic with any mental disorder was reported by 8.21%. One-third to almost two-thirds of somatic patients were also suffering from a mental disorder depending on the severity and multicomorbidity. Bipolar and psychotic patients and to a lesser extent depressives, manifested an earlier (15-20 years) manifestation of somatic multicomorbidity, severe disability, and probably earlier death. The overwhelming majority of patients with mental disorders were not receiving treatment or were being treated in a way that was not recommended. Antipsychotics and antidepressants were not related to the development of metabolic syndrome. The finding that one-third to almost two-thirds of somatic patients also suffered from a mental disorder strongly suggests that psychiatry is the field with the most trans-specialty and interdisciplinary value and application points to the importance of teaching psychiatry and mental health in medical schools and also to the need for more technocratically oriented training of psychiatric residents."

In a large amount of metastases, although they are small, they involve different parts of the hemispheres and consequently mental changes become more expressed.

All patients underwent psychotherapy using a cognitive-behavioral approach 2 times a week, as well as psychopharmacotherapy using SSRI antidepressants (fluvoxamine, sertraline). A standardized assessment method was used using the Children's Depression Inventory, the multivariate assessment of childhood anxiety, the Lazarus Coping Strategy Questionnaire, and the Eating Behavior Rating Scale. The clinical severity and severity of depression were significantly more often detected in girls of the older adolescent group (<i>U</i>=4.5, <i>p</i><0.05). The highest scores in adolescents of middle and older groups were found on the scales «Decrease in mental activity due to anxiety» (1.52 and 1.64 points respectively), «Increased autonomic reactivity due to anxiety» (1.46 and 1.55 points respectively), «Anxiety related to the evaluation of others» (1.51 and 1.61 points respectively), as well as «Anxiety in relations with peers» (1.53 and 1.64 points respectively). A correlation was found between the severity of anxiety and depression and the choice of certain coping strategies (<i>p</i><0.05). In both age groups, adolescents more often used maladaptive behavioral strategies. The results suggest the importance of choosing an individual way to build a cognitive-behavioral therapy plan, taking into account personal responses and the emotional status of adolescents with ED."

Examinations were performed in 110 patients (predominantly women (n=97 (88.2%); mean age, 49.9±2.47 years) with a documented diagnosis of SSD (its mean duration, 7.25±0.42 years). 62 (56.4%) patients had limited SSD, 36 (32.7%) had diffuse SSD, and 12 (10.9%) had overlap syndrome. The disease was rapidly and slowly progressive in 33 (30%) and 77 (70%) patients, respectively. Oral glucocorticosteroids were used in 99 (90%) patients included in the study, cytotoxic drugs in 66 (60%), plaquenil in 33 (30%); 8 (7%) patients were treated with the biological agent rituximab. All the patients were examined by a psychologist and a psychiatrist. The psychopathological diagnosis of MD was made during a semistructured interview in accordance with the ICD-10 criteria. The Montgomery-Asberg depression and Hamilton anxiety rating scales were used to evaluate the severity of depression and anxiety, respectively. All patients underwent a clinical and psychological examination, including tests assessing memory, attention, and logical thinking, as well as projective techniques. MDs were detected in 91 (83%) patients with SSD. There was a preponderance of depressive disorders in 74 (67.3%) patients: chronic (dysthymia in 33 (30%) patients)) and recurrent (recurrent depressive disorder in 34 (31%)) depressions. Cognitive impairment (CI) of varying severities was diagnosed in 100% of the patients. Schizotypal personality disorder was stated in 44 (40%) patients. 90% of patients were found to have chronic psychic traumas mainly as parental deprivation in childhood (in children less than 11 years of age). 76.7% of the SSD cases developed recurrent episodes of depression in the presence of long-term MD or had a history of the episodes. There was no relationship of MD to gender, age, duration of SSD and its individual clinical manifestations. The nature of SSD treatment did not affect the frequency and spectrum of MD. MDs, predominantly chronic and recurrent depression, and CI are characteristic of most SSD patients. Multiple chronic stressful factors, both previous SSD and those over time, have commonly an impact on the mental health of patients with SSD."

All patients were examined in detail by a psychiatrist and clinical psychologists. The method of integrative assessment of the pathopsychological profile was used, including the assessment of the presence and severity of impairments in cognitive functioning, emotional-personal and motivational-volitional spheres (the assessment was carried out according to detailed psychological reports). Mathematical processing of the obtained data was carried out. Cluster analysis of clinical and psychological indicators showed that patients differ in the level of intellectual impairment, as well as in the characteristics of motivational-volitional and personal spheres. Three clusters are described, two of which included patients (10 and 31 patients) with individual variants of STD with a greater severity of various cognitive deficits, and parameters of the emotional and personal sphere, the last cluster included 6 patients with personality variants of STD. A separate largest cluster included all three analyzed variants of STD in approximately equal proportions, with a mildly pronounced intellectual decline and more noticeable changes (deficiency) in the emotional and personal sphere. Thus, patients with STD differ in the severity and structure of deficient changes. At the same time, the nature and degree of involvement of a particular area in the overall picture of the pathopsychological profile is of great importance. Patients with STD differ in the severity and structure of deficient changes. The identified clusters differed in age, in the presence of patients of both sexes, and in various indicators of the pathopsychological profile. At the same time, the nature and degree of involvement of a particular area in the overall picture of the pathopsychological profile is important for diagnosis."

Clinical symptoms were different by the severity and phenomenology of tic hyperkineses in patients with PANS compared to the patients with tics without immune disorders. Most of the patients were diagnosed with Tourette syndrome. ADHD was the most common diagnosis in the PANS group. Its frequency was 2.5 higher in the male patients. A chronic focus of infection did no predict the development of PANS.

By that fact, it can't be excluded that affective processes moderate the association between cognition and genes. EEG parameters could be useful phenotypes in the search for and understanding of genetic mechanisms of cognitive deficit in depression. Parameters of resting EEG and its reactive changes are known to reflect the certain cognitive processes.

Phenotypic heterogeneity is pronounced in PD and nonmotor symptoms dominant subtypes have been described. These endophenotypes may be underpinned by considerable nondopaminergic dysfunction; however, conventional treatment of PD continues to be mostly reliant on dopamine replacement strategy or manipulation of brain dopaminergic pathways. Consequently, treatment of many nondopaminergic nonmotor and some motor symptoms remains a key unmet need. It is also recognized that treatment strategies for PD are influenced by a number of nondrug-related issues. These include factors such as age, personality, and preferences for treatment, cultural beliefs, lifestyle, pharmacoeconomics, pharmacogenetics as well as comorbidity. Therefore, the success of clinical therapy will rest on how much these factors are considered to develop a truly holistic treatment plan. Personalized medicine is the modern way of delivering this holistic strategy for treatment of PD. Personalized medicine thus encompasses several strands of treatment. From the pharmaceutical point of view, it should involve dopaminergic and nondopaminergic strategies. In addition, there are substrategies involving precision and tailored medicine to suit the needs and requirements of individual patients. Precision medicine would be relevant for patients who may be at risk of developing the clinical syndrome of Parkinson's as identified by specific gene mutations. Precision medicine in this scenario will attempt to be preventive. Tailored medicine would address the \"single multifactorial\" complex nature of PD and address symptoms as well subtype-specific strategies. Personalized medicine is now practiced for other conditions such as oncology as well as diabetes. In this chapter, we discuss the rationale and the need to develop strategies for personalized medicine for PD."

However, the data on circulating cfDNA in severe psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (BD), and depressive disorders (DDs), is contradictory. This meta-analysis aimed to analyze the concentrations of different cfDNA types in schizophrenia, BD, and DDs compared with healthy donors. The mitochondrial (cf-mtDNA), genomic (cf-gDNA), and total cfDNA concentrations were analyzed separately. The effect size was estimated using the standardized mean difference (SMD). Eight reports for schizophrenia, four for BD, and five for DDs were included in the meta-analysis. However, there were only enough data to analyze the total cfDNA and cf-gDNA in schizophrenia and cf-mtDNA in BD and DDs. It has been shown that the levels of total cfDNA and cf-gDNA in patients with schizophrenia are significantly higher than in healthy donors (SMD values of 0.61 and 0.6, respectively; <i>p</i> < 0.00001). Conversely, the levels of cf-mtDNA in BD and DDs do not differ compared with healthy individuals. Nevertheless, further research is needed in the case of BD and DDs due to the small sample sizes in the BD studies and the significant data heterogeneity in the DD studies. Additionally, further studies are needed on cf-mtDNA in schizophrenia or cf-gDNA and total cfDNA in BD and DDs due to insufficient data. In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides the first evidence of increases in total cfDNA and cf-gDNA in schizophrenia but shows no changes in cf-mtDNA in BD and DDs. Increased circulating cfDNA in schizophrenia may be associated with chronic systemic inflammation, as cfDNA has been found to trigger inflammatory responses."

The psychosomatic symptoms are represented by a wide range of symptom complexes (from idiopathic pain and conversions to restricted hypochondria, organ neuroses, encapsulated organ psychosis) and defined as a syndrome of endoform of somaticized disorders. The syndrome is interpreted beyond schizophrenia as «the second disease», a type of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, in which negative process changes have stopped while the other component (positive psychopathological symptoms) continues to develop."

        "abstract": "Although environmental factors have been studied for their impact on mental health, the link between ambient temperature and mental disorders remains insufficiently explored. This study aimed to explore the relationship between ambient temperature and the frequency of emergency psychiatric consultations at the sole university hospital in Paraguay from 2021 to 2023. This investigation adopted a quantitative, observational, cross-sectional design, using a case-crossover approach. Data collection entailed reviewing patient records and meteorological data, focusing on the daily mean temperatures and other meteorological variables. Statistical analysis was conducted using RStudio and SPSS, applying a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) for a seven-day lag period. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for the likelihood of specific diagnoses resulting in emergency consultations in relation to temperature exposure. The analysis covered 2,186 first-time emergency psychiatric consultations, with anxiety disorders being the most frequent diagnosis (24.3%), followed by depressive disorders (23.4%) and personality disorders (15.8%). Women accounted for 70.6% of all patients. The findings indicated that higher temperatures were associated with a greater frequency of consultations for certain disorders, including bipolar (OR up to 27.12 at Lag 1) and eating disorders (OR up to 100 at Lag 1). Conversely, a negative association was observed for schizophrenia, dissociative disorders, and trauma- and stressor-related disorders as temperature increased. Additionally, a linear relationship was found between lower relative humidity and increased number of consultations. The findings underscore the impact of ambient temperature on psychiatric emergency consultations, revealing that the frequency of consultations for different conditions varies with temperature. These insights could inform public health strategies to mitigate the effects of climatic variation on mental health. These findings suggest the need for targeted mental health interventions to address vulnerabilities during periods of climatic stress, particularly in resource-limited settings."

One hundred and nineteen female patients, aged from 16 to 26 years, were examined. Three groups were identified: patients meeting the criteria of high risk of psychosis (51 patients, mean age 18.55±3.84 years), patients not meeting the criteria of high risk of psychosis(48 patients, mean age 20.12±3.84 years), patients with postpsychotic depression (20 patients, mean age 21.8±4.5 years). The main method of the study was the application of COGDIS (Cognitive Distortions) and COPER (Cognitive-perceptual baseline symptoms) criteria. The baseline symptoms criteria were met by 83.3% of depressed patients without psychosis risk symptoms (mean severity score 24.0±14.7), 96% of depressed patients with high psychosis risk symptoms (38.1±15.9 points), and 50% of patients with postpsychotic depression (15.3±12.9 points). COGDIS criteria were met by 62.5% of depressed patients without psychosis risk symptoms (16.2±10.1 points), 68.6% of depressed patients with high psychosis risk symptoms (22.3±9.6 points), and 25% of patients with postpsychotic depression (9.2±8.4 points). The COPER criteria were met by 77.5% of patients with depression without psychosis risk symptoms (16.2±10.3 points), 92.2% of patients with depression at high risk of psychosis (28.4±14.0 points), and 50% of patients with postpsychotic depression (8.9±9.7 points). The group with post schizophrenic depression was characterized by lower basic symptom scale scores and percentage of eligible patients. Basic symptoms were common in a group of young female patients with depression who did not meet high-risk criteria. The score differentiates the high-risk group from the group of patients without risk symptoms."

Nevertheless, the interplay between beliefs, attitudes, previous experience with mental disorders, and knowledge of Ghanaians on specific mental disorders remains to be understood. The present study explored the interconnectedness between gender stereotypes, prejudice, previous experience with social phobia, and MHL among the general population in Ghana. Six hundred and one Ghanaians were recruited for an online experimental study design using a survey approach for data gathering. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions (i.e., male and female vignettes) depicting symptoms of social phobia for a hypothetical person. Participants further completed self-reported measures including gender stereotypes (based on Ambivalent Sexism Inventory) and prejudice. Results revealed a 15.5% recognition rate for social phobia. Recognition rates of social phobia did not differ by the experimental condition or by the gender of participants. However, personal experience of social phobia was positively related to an increased likelihood of correctly labeling social phobia among men in the female vignette condition, whereas correct recognition of social phobia was negatively related to prejudice among women in the male vignette condition. In the male vignette condition, men with more hostile sexism attitudes toward men exhibited more prejudice toward their hypothetical male counterpart. In contrast, women with hostile sexism attitudes toward men exhibited less prejudice, but greater benevolent sexism attitudes toward men was associated with more prejudice toward the hypothetical male in the vignette. Findings from the current study emphasize the role of the cultural milieu in shaping effective mental health interventions. The results also have implications for promoting MHL to reduce prejudice in Ghana and other developing countries in the region."

The study included male and female patients, aged 17-69 years, with a diagnosis of hypochondriac schizophrenia (F20.80 according to ICD-10) and asthenia symptoms. The main research method was clinical, which was supplemented by pathopsychological examination and the use of psychometric scales (PANSS, SANS, MFI-20,VAS asthenia). Asthenia in case of hypochondriac schizophrenia (schizoasthenia) integrates two unrelated phenomena: «weakness» and «exhaustion» (intolerance to stress), and also acts within the framework of three psychopathological syndromes: neurotic, senestopathic/hypochondriac and overvalued hypochondria. Asthenia with hypochondriac schizophrenia is a predictor of an unfavorable social and clinical prognosis. Integrating into the structure of the clinical manifestations of hypochondriac schizophrenia, asthenia forms close relationships with positive and negative disorders of the type of «general syndromes», but remains outside the categories of both positive and negative symptoms of the disease, thus forming a separate «dimension» in the psychopathological space of schizophrenia."

Polypharmacy was observed in 67.86% of patients, 75 prescriptions of potentially inappropriate medications and 156 cases of potential prescribing omissions were identified. The highest frequency was observed for STOPP criteria related to the use of medications with anticholinergic properties. The median anticholinergic burden score was 2.5 [0.0; 6.0]. The START criteria with the highest frequency were related to recommendations for pharmacotherapy of comorbid somatic conditions, mainly the prescription of statins and antiplatelet agents in patients with vascular diseases. The study demonstrated a moderate frequency of STOPP criteria and a high frequency of START criteria. The application of the updated STOPP/START criteria in psychiatric care should contribute to improving the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapy."

The neurobiological causes and mechanisms of psychopathologies still have not been definitively determined. Various forms of brain proteinopathies, which include a disruption of protein conformations and the formation of protein aggregates in brain tissues, may be a possible cause behind the development of psychiatric disorders. Proteinopathies are known to be the main cause of neurodegeneration, but much less attention is given to the role of protein impairments in psychiatric disorders' pathogenesis, such as depression and schizophrenia. For this reason, the aim of this review was to discuss the potential contribution of protein illnesses in the development of psychopathologies. The first part of the review describes the possible mechanisms of disruption to protein folding and aggregation in the cell: endoplasmic reticulum stress, dysfunction of chaperone proteins, altered mitochondrial function, and impaired autophagy processes. The second part of the review addresses the known proteins whose aggregation in brain tissue has been observed in psychiatric disorders (amyloid, tau protein, α-synuclein, DISC-1, disbindin-1, CRMP1, SNAP25, TRIOBP, NPAS3, GluA1, FABP, and ankyrin-G)."

Most often, PTSD is detected in combat veterans, victims of terrorist attacks and terror, but it can also be a consequence of traumatic brain injury and medical interventions. Impaired cognitive functioning is a key feature of PTSD, including attention deficits and reduced processing speed, executive dysfunction, and impairments in verbal learning and memory. Cognitive impairments in PTSD are significantly persistent and are largely similar in nature to neuropsychological impairments in neurodegenerative pathology. Possible pathogenetic mechanisms underlying PTSD are the development of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and decreased production of neurotrophic factors. One of the promising areas of treatment is the use of Cerebrolysin, which has powerful neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory activity."

        "abstract": "Hemoglobin is a tetramer consisting of two α-chains and two β-chains of globin. Hereditary aberrations in the synthesis of one of the globin chains are at the root of thalassemia, one of the most prevalent monogenic diseases worldwide. In humans, in addition to α- and β-globins, embryonic zeta-globin and fetal γ-globin are expressed. Immediately after birth, the expression of fetal Aγ- and Gγ-globin ceases, and then adult β-globin is mostly expressed. It has been shown that in addition to erythroid cells, hemoglobin is widely expressed in nonerythroid cells including neurons of the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum in rodents; embryonic and adult brain neurons in mice; and mesencephalic dopaminergic brain cells in humans, mice, and rats. Lately, there is growing evidence that different forms of anemia (changes in the number and quality of blood cells) may be involved in (or may accompany) the pathogenesis of various cognitive and mental disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, depression of various severity levels, bipolar disorders, and schizophrenia. Higher hemoglobin concentrations in the blood may lead to hyperviscosity, hypovolemia, and lung diseases, which may cause brain hypoxia and anomalies of brain function, which may also result in cognitive deficits. In this study, a search for unannotated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of erythroid genes was initially performed using our previously created and published SNP-TATA_Z-tester, which is a Web service for computational analysis of a given SNP for in silico estimation of its influence on the affinity of TATA-binding protein (TBP) for TATA and TATA-like sequences. The obtained predictions were finally verified in vitro by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). On the basis of these experimental in vitro results and literature data, we studied TATA box SNPs influencing both human erythropoiesis and cognitive abilities. For instance, TBP-TATA affinity in the HbZ promoter decreases 6.6-fold as a result of a substitution in the TATA box (rs113180943), thereby possibly disrupting stage-dependent events of \"switching\" of hemoglobin genes and thus causing erythroblastosis. Therefore, rs113180943 may be a candidate marker of severe hemoglobinopathies with comorbid cognitive and mental disorders associated with cerebral blood flow disturbances. The literature data and experimental and computations results suggest that the uncovered candidate SNP markers of erythropoiesis anomalies may also be studied in cohorts of patients with cognitive and/or mental disorders with comorbid erythropoiesis diseases in comparison to conventionally healthy volunteers. Research into the regulatory mechanisms by which the identified SNP markers contribute to the development of hemoglobinopathies and of the associated cognitive deficits will allow physicians not only to take timely and adequate measures against hemoglobinopathies but also to implement strategies preventing cognitive and mental disorders."

        "abstract": "To develop a systematics of chronic delusional psychoses in schizophrenia and pathology of the schizophrenic spectrum that takes into account psychopathological structure (the mechanism of delusional formation) and the trajectories of the disease course (the ratio of negative/positive dimensions). The study sample was recruited from the large Moscow psychiatric hospital in 2019-2024 and included 126 patients (94 male, 32 female, mean age 36.5±12.1 years) hospitalized with ICD-10 diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia (F20.00) or delusional disorder (F22). A clinical-psychopathological method was used. The study identifies three variants of paranoid domains, the typology of which takes into account both the psychopathological structure and the trajectories of their development, which determine the dominance of predominantly negative or positive symptoms throughout the disease: 1) psychosis with delusional interpretations and predominant orientation of symptoms towards the negative pole of the schizophrenia psychopathology (<i>n</i>=37, 29.4%); 2) psychosis with hallucinatory delusions and predominant direction of symptoms towards the positive pole of the schizophrenia psychopathology (<i>n</i>=50, 39.7%); and 3) «combined» hallucinatory-delusional psychosis with a simultaneous orientation of symptoms to the negative/positive poles of the schizophrenia psychopathology (<i>n</i>=39, 30.9%). Detailed phenomenological characteristics of each of the three presented variants are given. The developed three-component taxonomy confirms, on the model of chronic delusional psychoses appearing in schizophrenia and the pathology of the schizophrenia spectrum, the concept of simultaneous representation of two relatively independent domains determined by neurobiological processes in the schizophrenia psychopathology positive and negative disorders."

        "abstract": "To develop a technology for evaluating indicators of patient's compliance, taking into account clinical, socio-demographic, psychological characteristics of the patient and characteristics of the family environment, as well as factors of psychiatric care, based on appropriate compliance algorithms and models. The study included 107 patients (44 men and 63 women) with diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective and schizotypal disorders that met the criteria of ICD-10, as well as 105 members of their families. A set of 12 clinical and psychological questionnaires and scales was used for data collection. Clinical, statistical (correlation and regression analysis), system analysis methods, and the analytic hierarchy process were used. A technology for converting rank data into numerical information has been developed. The authors provide models for assessing compliance for groups of patients, which were selected based on awareness of the disease, syndromic characteristics, gender. An algorithm for evaluating the weighted, averaged prognosis (in %) of the patient's compliance level in the corresponding groups was developed. Examples of calculations for evaluating the prognosis of patient's compliance are given. The developed models for assessing the level of patient's compliance and the identified characteristics of patients, family environment and factors of psychiatric care that are important for compliance make it possible to increase the effectiveness of therapy, justify the choice of personal strategies for psychosocial and psychoeducational interventions, reduce the risk of re-hospitalization, and increase the level of social adaptation and quality of life of patients and their families."

The estimated global prevalence of cocaine use was 0·4% and amphetamine use was 0·7%, with dependence affecting 16% of people who used cocaine and 11% of those who used amphetamine. Stimulant use was associated with elevated mortality, increased incidence of HIV and hepatitis C infection, poor mental health (suicidality, psychosis, depression, and violence), and increased risk of cardiovascular events. No effective pharmacotherapies are available that reduce stimulant use, and the available psychosocial interventions (except for contingency management) had a weak overall effect. Generic approaches can address mental health and blood borne virus infection risk if better tailored to mitigate the harms associated with stimulant use.

Predictors of unfavorable outcome found in the acute period of mental trauma were as follows: affective tension, impulsivity, high personal anxiety and depressive tendencies with reduced activity. Comparing to clinical evaluation, subjective criteria of mental state (self-rating) retained its informativeness for prognosis of protracted PTSD types.

The Hb receives inputs from the septum, basal ganglia, hypothalamus, anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex, and projects to several midbrain centers, most importantly the inhibitory rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) and the excitatory interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), which regulate the activity of midbrain monoaminergic nuclei. The Hb is postulated to play a key role in reward and aversion processing across species, including humans, and to be implicated in the different stages of transition from recreational drug intake to addiction and co-morbid mood disorders. The Hb is divided into two anatomically and functionally distinct nuclei, the lateral (LHb) and the medial (MHb), which are primarily involved in reward-seeking (LHb) and misery-fleeing (MHb) behavior by controlling the RMTg and IPN, respectively. This review provides a neuroanatomical description of the Hb, discusses preclinical and human findings regarding its role in the development of addiction and co-morbid mood disorders, and addresses future directions in this area."

The paper searches for various symptoms and predictors of the development of cognitive impairment in women in the PMP. The key features include certain difficulties in making a diagnosis at earlier stages. The relationship of metabolic disorders with factors negatively affecting the health of women in the PPP, as well as contributing to the deterioration of cognitive functions, is considered. Women are more at risk of developing cognitive impairment and represent a specific target group that requires special attention in assessing risk factors and methods for correcting cognitive disorders. To date, the relationship between gender and dementia risk still needs to be studied in more depth. Given this, menopause is an important physiological period, as it is accompanied by intense hormonal changes that may be the direct cause of cognitive decline. Many women experience mood disorders, anxiety, increased mental and/or physical fatigue, irritability, mild cognitive disorders, which requires an interdisciplinary approach by doctors to this issue. All these manifestations should be evaluated and corrected in time to avoid their progression and a decrease in the quality of life. An integrated approach to therapy, both medicinal and non-medicinal, can significantly improve the quality of life of patients in the PPP."

The high content of lymphoblasts is believed to be a characteristic feature of patients with schizophrenia (this type of cells belongs to so-called atypical lymphocytes described earlier). The atypical cells include also destructive lymphocytes, phagocyting monocytes and phagocyting neutrophiles. These atypical cells are observed more often in patients with acute schizophrenia. It has been suggested that the presence of an increased number of lymphoblasts in the blood of schizophrenic patients indicates the constant production of antigens and the presence of phagocyting cells reflects the processes of antigen neutralization."

The average age of psychosis manifestation was 19.8±2.5 months. Clinical, psychopathological, psychometric (PANSS and HDRS) and immunological («Neuro-immuno-test» technology) examinations were carried out at the psychotic state, during period of psychopathological symptoms reduction and further for 1-2 years until complete/significant reduction of psychotic symptoms. Three stages of remission are revealed: I - the stage of reduction and modification of leading psychotic symptoms, II - the stage of stabilization of mental functions, III - the stage of reintegration of mental functions. It has been shown that each stage corresponds to different features of clinical symptoms and also certain spectra of immune markers (activity of leukocyte elastase, α1-proteinase inhibitor and level of autoantibodies to S100-B and OBM proteins) in blood serum of patients. The differences in the spectra of immune parameters at the second stage of remission in patients with affective (depressive) disorders define various patterns of post-psychotic development of disease. The most representative are immunological features of the third stage of remission. The dynamics of immune markers in the course of remission can be considered as a biological criterion for assessment of the outcome of the first first-episode psychosis and the completeness of remission."

Thrombodynamics tests were performed on T-2 thrombodynamics analyzer ('Hemacore LLC', Moscow, Russia). For the first time, it was shown that in the patient population (n=46), the thrombodynamic parameters of the blood clot growth rate [initial velocity (Vi), steady-state velocity (Vst) and spontaneous clots adjusted velocity (V)] and clot size at 30 minute of thrombodynamics (Clot Size, CS) were significantly higher than normal values. The mean appearance of spontaneous clots (Tsp) was significantly lower than 30 minutes (p<0.0001) which indicated a rapid, spontaneous clots formation. The mean value of clot lag time (Tlag) and clot density (Density, D) did not differ significantly from normal values. The number of changed thrombodynamic parameters decreased in the following sequence: schizophrenia with different types of courses > schizotypal disorder>affective disorder. This is in good agreement with the fact that the course of affective disorders is more favorable than that in schizophrenia. The thrombodynamics test has a good potential for introduction into medicine to detect hypercoagulability and increased risks of thrombotic complications in patients, as well as to control for normalization of hemostasis with antiaggregant or anticoagulant drugs. Thrombodynamics makes it possible to identify a tendency to hypercoagulable states at an early stage, when other methods are still not sensitive enough.

A study was made of the psychoneurological status of 120 schoolchildren with biliary pathology. Three variants of the +cerebro-asthenic syndrome were revealed: ++astheno-adynamic, ++astheno-hyperdynamic and moderately marked ones. To objectively evaluate the mental status and the structure of mental activity disorders, all the children underwent an experimental and psychological examination. A relationship was discovered between the changes in mental activity and the variant of the cerebrasthenic syndrome and the child's age. The most remarkable changes in mental activity were recorded in children with the ++astheno-adynamic variant of the +cerebro-asthenic syndrome."

We studied 36 adolescent female patients (16-25 years) with endogenous depression (F31.3-4; F34.0; F21.3-4+F31.3-4; F60.X+F31.3-4), whose clinical picture was dominated by depersonalization disorders represented by their auto-, allo-, and somatopsychic forms or combinations. Depersonalization depressions in young female patients are characterized by the following features: the dominance of the manifestations of the sensory («hysterical») form of depersonalization (83.3%; <i>n</i>=30); the proximity of the phenomenon of somatopsychic depersonalization (77.8%, <i>n</i>=28) to the manifestations of dysmorphic disorders; the specificity of the manifestations of derealization in the form of a feeling of «pretended, staged» environment; infrequent manifestations of psychic anesthesia; marked polymorphism of the clinical picture with comorbid obsessive-compulsive, hysteria-conversion, senestopathic, dysmorphic, and attenuated psychotic disorders; high risk of suicide (83.3%; <i>n</i>=30) with the predominance of planned suicide attempts over impulsive ones; significant frequency and variety of nonsuicidal self-harm with the predominance of «depersonalizing» motives for its commission. Depersonalization depression in young female patients is characterized by the clinical specificity manifested both in depersonalization symptomatology and spectrum of comorbid disorders and in the specificity of motives and methods of suicide attempts and nonsuicidal self-harm."

Urban residents - 851 people (76.1%), rural dwellers - 268 (23.9%). Each respondent was offered one vignette describing a sick child aged 8-10 with ID: typical, dyslalic, bradypsychic and dysphoric. Mathematical and statistical processing included descriptive statistics and calculation of the χ2 distribution. 49.1% of the respondents have correctly recognized ID in vignettes. Out of the incorrect answers, various psychological characteristics prevailed (25.3%) of the child; negative character traits with pessimistic assessments (23.2%); illness, including mental disorders (18.6%); defects in education and upbringing (15.6%). The respondents most often (38.5%) suggested assistance by psychologists, especially to patients with a bradypsychic variant of ID, a speech therapist - with a dyslalic one, teachers - with a typical one, psychiatrists - with a dysphoric one. 85.3% of the respondents expected improvement in the child's condition after the specialist intervention. The probable causes of ID included improper upbringing and disharmonious family relations, more often in case of a typical variant, hereditary burden and early childhood diseases - in dyslalic, alcohol consumption, poverty - in dysphoric, all of the above - in case of a bradypsychic variant. The study has identified an insufficient level of public awareness of ID, reflecting its delayed diagnosis in children, peculiarities of the \"channels\" for seeking assistance with excessively high expectations of the condition improvements."

        "abstract": "The aim of the current study was to explore the effect of gender, age at onset, and duration on the long-term course of schizophrenia. Twenty-nine centers from 25 countries representing all continents participated in the study that included 2358 patients aged 37.21 ± 11.87 years with a DSM-IV or DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia; the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale as well as relevant clinicodemographic data were gathered. Analysis of variance and analysis of covariance were used, and the methodology corrected for the presence of potentially confounding effects. There was a 3-year later age at onset for females (<i>P</i> < .001) and lower rates of negative symptoms (<i>P</i> < .01) and higher depression/anxiety measures (<i>P</i> < .05) at some stages. The age at onset manifested a distribution with a single peak for both genders with a tendency of patients with younger onset having slower advancement through illness stages (<i>P</i> = .001). No significant effects were found concerning duration of illness. Our results confirmed a later onset and a possibly more benign course and outcome in females. Age at onset manifested a single peak in both genders, and surprisingly, earlier onset was related to a slower progression of the illness. No effect of duration has been detected. These results are partially in accord with the literature, but they also differ as a consequence of the different starting point of our methodology (a novel staging model), which in our opinion precluded the impact of confounding effects. Future research should focus on the therapeutic policy and implications of these results in more representative samples."

Experimental psychological methods were used together with psychotherapeutic approaches: Wiesbaden's questionnaire (WIPPF), Lusher's and MMPI tests. For each group of the patients some recommendations are given for application of the above techniques. Thus in patients from the 1-3 groups it is worthwhile to perform a positive psychotherapy directed to the development of the body/sensation sphere (according to WIPPF), that is a care about physical and mental state (including autotraining and training of communication). In the alcohol abusing patients the main point should be fantasy/future sphere (according to WIPPF) in the ranges of the same positive psychotherapy directed to forming positive world view and correction of the interpersonal relations."

The results of the long-term follow-up study of 320 patients with young-onset schizophrenia referred for psychiatric care in an outpatient clinic in Moscow from 1990 to 1994 were analyzed. Correlations between typological variants of the patient's condition during the follow-up and features of the dynamics of the schizophrenic process at different stages of the disease were studied. Clinical-psychopathological, clinical follow-up, clinical-epidemiological and a psychometric method were applied. The severity of symptoms at all stages of the disease correlates with typological variants of conditions at the stage of long-term follow-up. In the first type, there is an accumulation of personality desorders and the most prognostically favorable variants of the initial stage, manifestations of psychotic states, the disease often manifests with only one episode and has a regressive character, the disease process fades quite quickly, mainly high-and medium-quality remissions are formed. In the second type, there is an accumulation of less favorable signs - prolonged variants of the initial stage with a predominance of negative disorders, hallucinatory-delusional manifestations of psychoses with exacerbations after 10-12 years, the high frequency of progressive forms of disease course and remissions of moderate to low quality. Type 3 is characterized by the most severe combinations of positive and negative symptoms, paranoid forms of the initial stage, paranoid and catatonic manifestations of psychoses, a high number of relapses at all stages of the course, low-quality remissions and frequent transition of the disease to a continuous form."

The paper concerns the recent advances in the study of the structure and function of two main dopaminergic brain systems, i.e. nigrostriatal and mesolimbic. The problem of autoreceptor regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission, particularly the processes of dopamine synthesis, release, and metabolism is discussed. The involvement of D2 and D3 dopamine autoreceptors in the control of these processes and differences in the mode of action of typical neuroleptics are analyzed. It is hypothesized that dopamine D3 autoreceptor is preferentially involved in the regulation of dopamine release while D2 one is responsible for the control of dopamine synthesis and metabolism in rat basal ganglia in vivo."

Evidence is given of the role of certain personality parameters (rigidity, anxiety) and biological factors (the status of the immune and hormonal systems) in the formation and course of borderline conditions. The clinical studies carried out over time made it possible to specify definite stages in the development of borderline pathology. 3 stages were delineated: initial disorders or reactions; neurotic or neurosis-like conditions; neurotic or pathological developments of the personality. The authors demonstrate imperfection of the existing systems of psychiatric aid in respect to patients with borderline disorders and provide evidence for the necessity of organizing psychiatric services outside dispensary aid. Novel organizational models (the center for borderline conditions, the center for mental health care at industrial enterprises, municipal psychohygienic consultation) developed by the authors are provided as prognosis.

Two types of contrast obsession (CO) were recognized: contrast phobias with anxiety about possibility to commit autodestructive or criminal actions and contrast obsessions with anxious doubts about committing either violence or murder. CO of first type were determined by the fear of lack of self-control and possibility to commit autodestructive or criminal actions. Such obsessions are accompanied by bright images, massive somato-vegetative symptomatology and rapid formation of avoidance behaviour. CO of second type are characterized by pathologic doubts about committing violence or murder and accompanied by strong desire to check again and obsessive self-analysis. CO of first type belong to the spectrum of anxious-phobic disorders and are phobic in their nature; within acute phobic fit, similar in manifestations to a panic attack; they are associated with other phobic disorders and manifest like phobic depressions. On the contrary, CO of second type are true obsessive phenomena, and isolated, combine with obsessions of the repeated control, and with different types of depressions only in half of the cases."

All statistical calculations (descriptive statistics, between group comparisons using Fisher exact, binominal and Pearson chi-square tests, significant at two-tailed p<0.05) were performed with the IBM SPSS 27. 15% of inpatients and 52% of outpatients with mental disorders received ADs. ADs were prescribed for major depressive disorder and other diagnoses, including the majority of schizophrenia spectrum disorders and non-organic conditions. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, particularly fluvoxamine, were used most often for outpatient and inpatient settings, but at lower average dose rather than recommended, while tricyclic ADs were more likely to be correctly administered for severe depression. ADs were often prescribed within combined treatment rather than monotherapy, but clinical recommendations were not strictly followed in relation to the drug choice, combination with antipsychotic agents and switching strategies. The clinical reality of AD prescriptions in the studied psychiatric setting differed from the clinical guidelines, insofar as the choice of AD medication did not always follow evidence-based recommendations. Choice and dosage of ADs should properly follow duration and severity of the illness, and the clinical profile of disorders."

Multi-informant data (youth, parents and clinician) on the level of youth problem severity and functioning was gathered from 7169 youth and their families served by the IICAPS network, pre- and post-intervention. A newly developed \"Multi-informant Latent Consensus\" (MILC) approach was employed to measure mental health \"baseline levels\" and change, within a Structural Equation Modeling framework. The MILC approach demonstrated promise integrating information from multiple informants involved in the therapeutic process to yield a more accurate and systemic view of a child's level of functioning and problem severity than each report taken individually. Results indicated that the IICAPS family and community based intervention model led to a reduction of problem severity and improved functioning in children and adolescents with severe emotional disturbance."

This index was also determined in their mothers. Significant elevation of a titer of aAB to NGF was observed in blood of children from groups 1 and 2 as well as in their mothers, as compared with 3 and 4 groups. Among the mothers of the children from 1 and 2 groups there were met women with different endogenous mental disorders, with the disorders of personality as well as mentally healthy women. An increase of a level of aAB to NGF was found in all the women from groups 1 and 2, independently of their mental status including mentally healthy women.

In addition, protests against arrivals coming from a covid-risk area were known. Stigma and fear can severely impede efforts to manage the spread of COVID-19 outbreak. The predisposing factors in the development of COVID-19 stigma are lack of knowledge, rapid spread of the virus, relatively high mortality, and lack of effective treatment. Meanwhile, at the level of society, particular processes are taking place, when not only infected, but also healthy members of society become subject to stigmatization, who can be determined as \"probably\" infected.

A prospective study of patients with confirmed hematological diseases and psychopathological hysterical disorders. Of the 373 patients examined during the study for psychiatric disorders, 108 patients who met the criteria of the present study were identified. The study employed a clinical and psychopathological method with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The following psychopathological disorders were identified in the studied patients: depressive episode in 29.6% (<i>n=</i>32), somatoform disorders in 19.5% (<i>n=</i>21), dissociative [conversion] disorders in 7.4% (<i>n=</i>8), nightmares in 6.5% (<i>n=</i>7), and other specified anxiety disorders in 33.3% (<i>n=</i>36). Among the features of the psychopathological disorders under consideration are the reduction of clinical manifestations and a pronounced asthenic background with associated hysterical disorders due to a severe somatic condition and side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. Psychopathological hysterical disorders, manifesting in patients with hematological diseases, are one of the reasons for the deviation from the treatment protocols for such patients. Psychopharmaceuticals are used in the minimum effective dose for the treatment of the non-psychotic disorders under consideration; if necessary, the doses are increased to an appropriate level for the psychopathological disorder. In some cases, psychopharmacotherapy is combined with psychotherapy interventions."

It is unclear whether these alterations are associated with clinical depression or exist already at preclinical stages. Here, in clinically healthy individuals, a combination of neuroticism and introversion was used as a predisposition to depression (PD) scale. Participants were presented with pictures of emotional facial expressions and performed the gender discrimination task, while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The affective processing bias (i.e., longer reaction time and higher error rate for angry faces) was found in low, but not in high PD scorers. High PD scorers also showed reduced theta synchronization and enhanced alpha desynchronization in the test interval and higher delta and theta power in the interstimuli interval. The latter effect implies that activity of emotional circuits, which is mirrored in low-frequency oscillations, is tonically increased in predisposed-to-depression individuals, thus precluding an adequate response to external emotional cues. This results in unspecific general activation reflected in enhanced alpha desynchronization and in disrupted ability to differentiate incoming emotional information."

        "abstract": "The ENIGMA clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis initiative, the largest pooled neuroimaging sample of individuals at CHR to date, aims to discover robust neurobiological markers of psychosis risk. To investigate baseline structural neuroimaging differences between individuals at CHR and healthy controls as well as between participants at CHR who later developed a psychotic disorder (CHR-PS+) and those who did not (CHR-PS-). In this case-control study, baseline T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were pooled from 31 international sites participating in the ENIGMA Clinical High Risk for Psychosis Working Group. CHR status was assessed using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States or Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes. MRI scans were processed using harmonized protocols and analyzed within a mega-analysis and meta-analysis framework from January to October 2020. Measures of regional cortical thickness (CT), surface area, and subcortical volumes were extracted from T1-weighted MRI scans. Independent variables were group (CHR group vs control group) and conversion status (CHR-PS+ group vs CHR-PS- group vs control group). Of the 3169 included participants, 1428 (45.1%) were female, and the mean (SD; range) age was 21.1 (4.9; 9.5-39.9) years. This study included 1792 individuals at CHR and 1377 healthy controls. Using longitudinal clinical information, 253 in the CHR-PS+ group, 1234 in the CHR-PS- group, and 305 at CHR without follow-up data were identified. Compared with healthy controls, individuals at CHR exhibited widespread lower CT measures (mean [range] Cohen d = -0.13 [-0.17 to -0.09]), but not surface area or subcortical volume. Lower CT measures in the fusiform, superior temporal, and paracentral regions were associated with psychosis conversion (mean Cohen d = -0.22; 95% CI, -0.35 to 0.10). Among healthy controls, compared with those in the CHR-PS+ group, age showed a stronger negative association with left fusiform CT measures (F = 9.8; P < .001; q < .001) and left paracentral CT measures (F = 5.9; P = .005; q = .02). Effect sizes representing lower CT associated with psychosis conversion resembled patterns of CT differences observed in ENIGMA studies of schizophrenia (ρ = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.55; P = .004) and individuals with 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome and a psychotic disorder diagnosis (ρ = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.61; P = .001). This study provides evidence for widespread subtle, lower CT measures in individuals at CHR. The pattern of CT measure differences in those in the CHR-PS+ group was similar to those reported in other large-scale investigations of psychosis. Additionally, a subset of these regions displayed abnormal age associations. Widespread disruptions in CT coupled with abnormal age associations in those at CHR may point to disruptions in postnatal brain developmental processes."

Comorbid mental disorders of the anxiety spectrum, eating behavior, substance abuse, and psychotic symptoms were assessed and recorded. The Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) was used to assess the severity of anhedonia. Patients with an earlier onset of depression (<i>p</i>=0.037) and a history of suicide attempts (<i>p</i>=0.001) showed higher scores for anhedonia. The generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, bulimia nervosa, and alcohol dependence in patients with current depression were associated with higher anhedonia. The anhedonia scores had moderate positive correlations with a number of personality traits on TCI-125: Harm Avoidance (<i>r</i>=0.30; <i>p</i><0.01), as well as weak negative correlations with Reward dependence (<i>r</i>= -0.20; <i>p</i><0.05) and Cooperativeness (<i>r</i>= -0.26; <i>p</i><0.05). There were also weak positive correlations of anhedonia scores with the severity of suicidal ideation and suicidal risk (for the last month and throughout life) and moderate positive correlations with the severity of suicidal behavior throughout life. The study confirms and expands the information about the complex nature of the anhedonia phenomenon in patients with depression. Further research on anhedonia may help in clinical practice and become the basis for the search for new biomarkers of depression."

Psychopathological, pathopsychological, psychometric and statistical methods were used. The Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) was used as a formalized tool for assessing the clinical symptoms of STD. Based on the prevailing symptoms, the clinical sample of patients was divided into 3 groups. The 1st group consisted of 56 (32.5%) patients with a predominance of neurosis-like disorders, the 2nd group - 50 (37.7%) patients with a predominance of behavioral disorders, the 3rd group included 45 (29.8%) patients with the dominance of stable personality anomalies. Significant differences between the groups were found in the frequency and severity of psychopathological symptoms, the structure of deficient (negative disorders), the age of onset of disorders, the characteristics of social activity and adaptation. According to the SPQ scale, positive disorders prevailed in group 1 compared to group 3: ideas of attitude (3.3 and 2.7 points respectively), unusual sensations and perceptions (3, 1 and 1.7 points respectively). STD is a spectrum of disorders, on one end of which there are variants with a predominance of positive disorders, on the other negative ones. The predominance of certain psychopathological symptoms is due to the age of onset of psychopathological disorders, age at the time of the current exacerbation, and the duration of persistence of the disease. The predominance of neurosis-like, psychopathic-like disorders and persistent personality anomalies makes it possible to classify STD as one of the identified types, which allows us to substantiate differentiated therapy and prognosis."

Mean values of psycho-emotional testing in the main group were high before surgery and significantly decreased on the 1<sup>st</sup> day after operation. However, advanced anxiety and aggravation of depression occurred in 14% of patients (n=14) that affected cognitive sphere (p<0.01). Progressive cognitive impairment was noted in the control group. Carotid endarterectomy has a positive long-term effect on initially impaired neurocognitive functions (3 and 6 months) (p<0.05). There were no significant differences in cognitive testing data in subgroups of eversion and classical procedures (p>0.05). Early postoperative depressive disorders significantly increase the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction."

        "abstract": "To evaluate the association of polymorphisms in the <i>TAAR1-9</i> gene cluster on chromosome 6 with cognitive functions in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and healthy controls. Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (<i>n</i>=216) and healthy people without a family history of mental disorders (<i>n</i>=240) completed a battery of cognitive tests, from which individual indices of cognitive functioning were derived. Associations of the cognitive index with 22 polymorphisms in the <i>TAAR</i> genes were assessed using ANCOVA controlling for sex, age, genetic structure of the sample, and polygenic risk scores of schizophrenia and intelligence. An interaction effect between group and genotype on the cognitive index was found at the rs3813355 site in the <i>TAAR5</i> gene (F=6.68; <i>p</i>=0.010; η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>=0.02). A <i>post hoc</i> analysis revealed genotype-related differences in the patient group. Homozygotes for the common <i>A</i> allele had a milder cognitive deficit than carriers of the minor <i>G</i> allele (<i>t</i>=2.75; <i>p</i>=0.032; Cohen's d=0.38).

        "abstract": "The study of diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) at the molecular level is challenging because of the complexity of neural circuits and the huge number of specialized cell types. Moreover, genomic association studies have revealed the complex genetic architecture of schizophrenia and other genetically determined mental disorders. Investigating such complex genetic architecture to decipher the molecular basis of CNS pathologies requires the use of high-throughput models such as cells and their derivatives. The time is coming for high-throughput genetic technologies based on CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat)/Cas systems to manipulate multiple genomic targets. CRISPR/Cas systems provide the desired complexity, versatility, and flexibility to create novel genetic tools capable of both altering the DNA sequence and affecting its function at higher levels of genetic information flow. CRISPR/Cas tools make it possible to find and investigate the intricate relationship between the genotype and phenotype of neuronal cells. The purpose of this review is to discuss innovative CRISPR-based approaches for studying the molecular mechanisms of CNS pathologies using cellular models."

Ninety-one patients, 80 women and 11 men, aged 13-24 years old, who independently applied to the SPbSPMU consulting center, were selected. The patients were examined clinically as well as using the Russian-language adapted version of the Inventory of Statements about Self-injury. The younger subgroup consisted of 54 people under the age of 18, another group of age above 18 numbered 37 participants. At the preliminary stage, patients with schizophrenia, organic mental disorders, etc were excluded. Based on the clinical and psychopathological assessment, 3 clinical groups were identified. The first group (<i>n=</i>50) consisted of patients under 18 years old with different subtypes of pubertal behavioral disorders (ICD-10 F91) and patients with emotionally unstable personality disorder (F60.3). The second group is represented by patients with mild or moderate depressive episodes (F32). The third group included patients with various eating disorders. The selected groups did not differ by the age of patients, the age of onset of self-injurious behavior and its duration. There were also no differences in the leading types of NSSI depending on gender, age subgroup, or clinical diagnosis, which confirms the currently prevailing view on NSSI as a transnosological phenomenon. The motives of NSSI also did not differ depending on the nosological form. Gender and age differences in the motives of NSSI were revealed. In male patients, the motive of «sensations seeking» (<i>p=</i>0.037) and «peer-bonding» (<i>p=</i>0.036) significantly prevailed. In the younger age subgroup, the motives of «self-punishment» (<i>p=</i>0.032) and «peer-bonding» (<i>p=</i>0.026) prevail. The nosological non-specificity of NSSI, which is manifested in the similarity of the age of onset, duration, types of NSSI and motives for committing them in different disorders, allows us to consider this phenomenon as a separate dimensional characteristic of a mental illness, more dependent on internal patterns, gender and age characteristics than on its nosological affiliation."

Two types of obsessive-phobic disorders with the phenomena of mysophobia were distinguished: obsession of the external (extracorporal) threat and obsession of contamination. Disorders of the first type (25 cases) were observed in psychopathic-like schizophrenia. They were characterized by a fear of possible contacts with different pathogenic agents--toxic substances, sharp small subjects, bacteria. Obsessions presented with a system of actions preventing phobic situations (rituals). With progression of the disease there was a decrease of both the degree and affective saturation of phobic disorders together with preserving rituals. Negative disorders presented with rough psychopathic-like changes with features of the \"verschroben\" defect. The disorders of the second type (29 patients) were observed in neurosis-like schizophrenia. Mysophobia manifested with both the repeated control and the fear of contamination accomplished. Ritual behavior presented with repeated actions and repeated control of the \"sterility\" of the own body and the surrounding subjects. Dynamics of these disorders was characterized by a tendency to more severe rituals of the control and persisting anxiety.

RPP indices in patients with schizophrenia and their relatives differed significantly from those in the control group of healthy subjects without positive family history of schizophrenia. The RPP heritability was estimated as high (58%). In RPP patients, RPP clustered with parameters of attention, memory, dynamic and intellectual activity; in the siblings--with attention, dynamic and intellectual activity and the width of anterior horns of left and right lateral ventricules next to genum, in the parents--with motivation, attention, memory, dynamic and intellectual activity. In the siblings, heritability for parameters of frontal horn lateral ventricules was estimated as high (66%) for the right ventricles and moderate (30%) for the left ones.

A total of 33 patients of both sexes (average age was 32.1 yrs) with symptoms of post-schizophrenic depression (F20.4 according to ICD-10) were examined by using clinical and psychometric methods in the dynamics of shift-like schizophrenia. HAMD-17, PANSS and CGI-S scales were applied. All the patients were subdivided into groups: mild, moderate and severe depressions. Valdoxan was used at a dose of 25-50 mg/day for 28 days along with preceding antipsychotic therapy at maintenance doses. Evaluation of the efficacy of treatment was carried out according to percentage reduction of average total score (ATS) in dynamics. A significant effect of valdoxan, with 73.5% of PANSS score reduction and quicker response to treatment, was identified. Therapeutic effect of valdoxan on separate components of PSD was uneven. The decrease of depressive disorders per se assessed by HAМD-17 and PANSS G-subscale was equally high (78.4 and 78.2%, respectively). Therapeutic reduction of negative disorders according to PANSS N-subscale was the lowest, at the level of 'good' effect (53.6%). In 27.3%, negative disorders were irreversible and were assessed as schizophrenic defect; in 72.7% of patients they were diagnosed as 'secondary' negative symptoms in atypical depression. In the subgroups of mild, moderate, and severe depression, the reduction of negative disorders was 62.4; 44.2 and 60.8%, respectively, and that of total PANSS score were 81.5; 66.1, and 78.6%, i.e. there was no correlation between these variables. Agomelatin (valdoxan) is an effective medication for optimization of methods of PSD treatment, providing the therapeutic effect at the level of significant or complete reduction of symptoms. The quality (depth) and rate of formation of response in the dynamics of course treatment are determined not by the severity of depressive disorders in PSD structure, but by the ratio between negative (deficit) symptoms and 'secondary' symptoms, reflecting the degree of progression of the main disease."

In all patients, pre-treatment multichannel background EEG was recorded with spectral power analysis in narrow frequency sub-bands. According to EEG data, the functional state of the cerebral cortex of patients in group 1 at the stage of remission was approaching normal. The EEG of group 2 and group 3 differed from the EEG of group 1 by significantly lower values of EEG spectral power in the alpha3 sub-band (11-13 Hz) in the occipital leads and a significantly increased content of theta1 (4-6 Hz) activity in the central-parietal areas. Such EEG frequency structure of patients in groups 2 and 3 reflects a reduced functional state of associative areas, and may also indicate dysfunction of the frontal parts of the cerebral cortex. These EEG features of patients in groups 2 and 3 are consistent with a significantly greater severity of their positive and negative symptoms on SAPS and SANS compared to group 1. In patients with depression at the stage of remission who have symptoms of an ultra-high risk of developing psychosis and in those who have suffered a psychotic episode, a reduced functional state of the associative and frontal areas of the cerebral cortex is noted, which may underlie the characteristics of their clinical condition."

We report here studies of the effects of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism on the probability that an individual will develop mental maladaptation in 224 close relatives of patients with severe chronic mental disorders - schizophrenia and schizoaffective and affective psychoses. The ss genotype of the serotonin transporter gene contributes to the formation predominantly of manifestations of distress, reflected by increases on the hypochondriasis scale of the MMPI scale of factors such as the extent of the autonomic component of anxiety reactions and increased attention to own health, as well as increases in sensitivity. At the same time, the ss genotype was less likely to influence the appearance of depression and anxiety, as determined on the depression scale. These tendencies were more marked in males than females. Furthermore, males with the ss genotype were characterized by some increase in tension, suspicion, detachment, and attention difficulty (on the paranoia and schizophrenia scales). These data can be regarded as supporting the role of the short allele of the serotonin transporter gene in enhancing and modulating psychopathological reactions to chronic stress situations in relatives of mental patients."

        "abstract": "Sixteen healthy people and 79 patients with panic disorders (PD), including 50 patients with neurosis (ICD-10 F40-41), 18 with personality disorder (F60) and 11 with schizotypal disorder (F21) have been studied. The main investigation method is recording of cognitive evoked potentials (P300 parameters). Mental and neuropsychological status of patients has been assessed as well. Despite the common clinical presentations of PD, peculiarities of evoked potentials reflecting sensory, activation and cognitive processes in different group of patients are revealed. The reduction of activation processes is observed in patients with neurosis and personality disorder combined with emotional instability in the latter ones. The increase of latency in response to non-target stimuli (a sensory component) is shown in schizotypal patients, the latter may be related to the decrease of activation of frontal-central brain areas."

        "abstract": "Mental illnesses are frequent co-morbid conditions in chronic systemic diseases. High incidences of depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment complicate cardiovascular and metabolic disorders such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Lifestyle changes including regular exercise have been advocated to reduce blood pressure and improve glycaemic control. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the effect of physical training on the most prevalent corollary psychiatric problems in patients with chronic organic ailments. This longitudinal study assessed the mental health of hypertensive (age: 57 ± 8 years) and/or diabetic (age: 53 ± 8 years) patients using mini-mental state examination, Beck's depression inventory, Beck's anxiety inventory and self-reporting questionnaire-20 before and after a 3-month supervised resistance and aerobic exercise programme comprising structured physical activity three times a week. Clinically relevant improvement was observed in the Beck's depression inventory and Beck's anxiety inventory scores following the 12-week training (61%, p = 0.001, and 53%, p = 0.02, respectively). Even though statistically not significant (p = 0.398), the cognitive performance of this relatively young patient population also benefited from the programme. These results demonstrate positive effects of active lifestyle on non-psychotic mental disorders in patients with chronic systemic diseases, recommending exercise as an alternative treatment option."

EEG was recorded from 12 leads monopolarly at rest, during hemisphere-specific cognitive tasks performance and exposure to aversive sound stimulation. Two-Hz wide EEG spectral ranges--A, theta1, theta2, alpha1 and alpha2--were analyzed. Only in the study group, there were decreased values of alpha2 spectral power (SP) and reduced reactivity to functional tests and insufficient lateral differentiation of the reactions during the cognitive tasks performance. Maximal deviation of the SP reactivity indices as compared to the comparison group was found in alpha2 range. The disturbances obtained indicate the delay of brain maturation and retardation in formation of specific neural networks. The results of the study demonstrate that indices of alpha2 SP may be considered as objective criteria of delayed mental maturation."

        "abstract": "International migration is a complex phenomenon of global and historical relevance. It includes voluntary, forced, and workforce migration, shaped by diverse determinants. Push factors comprise war, persecution, and political instability, while pull factors include stability, economic opportunities, education, and favorable living conditions. Forced migration is frequently associated with displacement and a disproportionate burden of mental health disorders, which are urgent yet difficult to address due to structural, cultural, and legal barriers. Evidence demonstrates that restricted health care access exacerbates psychiatric disorders, while treatment delays contribute to poorer outcomes. Barriers include administrative limitations, linguistic and cultural differences, stigma, and resource shortages. This policy paper was developed by the Committee on Ethics and the Task Force on Migration and Mental Health of the European Psychiatric Association (EPA). Relevant literature was reviewed and combined with the professional expertise of committee members. The draft was subsequently evaluated by the Publication Committee and the EPA Board, and revised accordingly. Ethical principles in refugee care are insufficiently implemented in many European countries. Core principles of medical ethics - beneficence, respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, and justice - as well as the obligation to advance psychiatric standards and apply psychiatric expertise for societal benefit, are inconsistently upheld. The primary duty of physicians is to promote health and well-being through competent, timely, and compassionate care. The EPA therefore advocates coordinated strategies to mitigate the mental health consequences of war, displacement, and trauma, and to secure equitable access to psychiatric services for migrants and refugees."

Level of use is usually defined around a behavioural pattern of the user (for example, cigarettes smoked per day, or average ethanol use in grams per day), while potency is defined as a property or characteristic of the substance. For all substances examined (alcohol, tobacco, opioids, cannabis) and gambling, both dimensions were taken into consideration in the formulation of most regulatory policies. However, the associations between both dimensions and regulatory policies were not systematic, and not always based on evidence. Future improvements are suggested."

Two groups of patients with the diagnosis of organic personality disorder (ICD-10 F07) established in the course of forensic-psychiatric examination were studied. The first group included 82 criminally prosecuted men (mean age 40.7±15.8); the second group comprised 50 women (mean age 65.1±15.4) and 28 men (mean age 60.2±14.4), who underwent forensic-psychiatric examination in civil litigation over declaring their contracts null and void. All patients had affective disorders. Standard expertise procedure and data analysis were used. The modifying influence of a set of psychogenic factors is of great significance in the course of forensic-psychiatric examination of individuals diagnosed with organic personality disorder: in criminal proceedings these are determined by the fact of being prosecuted, and in civil proceedings by the problems of adaptation, deterioration of one's social status, and the somatic ill-being. The unfavorable dynamics of organic mental disorder in these cases manifested itself in decompensation of personality, cognitive disturbances or addition of comorbid depressive disorders (68.3 and 31.7%, respectively). In 48.7% of patients, the addition of affective pathology to organic disorders significantly increased the extent of disturbance of cognitive functions, insight and prognostic capacity, volitional control of activity, which determined the incapacity of patients to understand the significance of their own actions and control them at the time of entering into contract."

The study was performed during 28 days using standard quantitative assay techniques in 79 patients with \"Organic emotional-liable (asthenic) disorders\" (F06.6, ICD-10). It was found that \"fast\" component of the psychotropic action of the drugs tested was presented by stimulating and anxiolytic effects, while a \"slow\" one--by specific nootropic activity. All these effects were fully independent with no correlation found, and this could, probably, be attributed to different mechanisms of their realization. It is shown that nootropic activity of piracetam was most significant in its therapeutic effect; and anxiolytic effect was most important for mexidol action. Meanwhile, stimulating and anxiolytic activities as well as positive influence on long-term memory were main components of tanacan effect. The results obtained show an important role of both specific and nonspecific (\"fast\") effects in realization of therapeutic action of the drugs with nootropic effects in patients with cognitive-mnestic and neurosis-like disorders."

The severity of current depression and the main clinical manifestations of BD were assessed by SIGH-SAD and CGI upon admission to the hospital before the prescription of therapy. Data analysis was carried out using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Comparison between subgroups of BD patients, selected in accordance with the current affective episode (hypomanic, manic, depressive and mixed), and control group by the Kruskal-Wallis test has shown the significant difference in <i>ANKRD12</i> protein product concentration (<i>p</i>=0.0448). When comparing pairwise each subgroup with the control group, the significant difference in <i>ANKRD12</i> product concentration was found only in the case of a subgroup of BD patients with current depressive episode (Mann-Whitney test, <i>p=</i>0.006). Pairwise comparison of the <i>ANKRD12</i> product concentrations in subgroups of BD patients with different disease duration (<5 years, 6-10 years, and >11 years) and in the control group by the Mann-Whitney test has revealed significant differences (<i>p=</i>0.04, <i>p</i>=0.01, <i>p=</i>0.02, respectively), the maximum protein concentration was found in patients with disease duration >11 years.

Group 2 included 103 adults with at least 85% of sleep efficiency completed the above methods, as well as the Dysfunctional Beliefs about Sleep Scale, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Glasgow Content of Thoughts Inventory, the Checklist of Subjective Reasons of Sleep Disturbances. The use of devices in the evenings and at nights was typical for more than 60% of the subjects and was associated with a worse subjective quality of sleep, its lower duration and efficiency, greater sleepiness and a feeling of 'lack of sleep' (r=0.21-0.39, p<0.05). The relationship between the use of devices, worse sleep quality and sleepiness was not explained by anxiety, depression, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep and ruminations before sleep (β=0.24, p<0.01, ΔR<sup>2</sup>=5.2% and β=0.24, p<0.01, ΔR<sup>2</sup>=5.0%, respectively), but became marginally significant after adjusting for general regularity in bedtime and awake.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in the genetics of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) have identified the transcription factor FOXP2 as one of numerous risk genes, e.g. in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). FOXP2 function is suggested to be involved in GABAergic signalling and numerous studies demonstrate that GABAergic function is altered in NDDs, thus disrupting the excitation/inhibition balance. Interestingly, GABAergic signalling components, including glutamate-decarboxylase 1 (Gad1) and GABA receptors, are putative transcriptional targets of FOXP2. However, the specific role of FOXP2 in the pathomechanism of NDDs remains elusive. Here we test the hypothesis that Foxp2 affects behavioural dimensions via GABAergic signalling using zebrafish as model organism. We demonstrate that foxp2 is expressed by a subset of GABAergic neurons located in brain regions involved in motor functions, including the subpallium, posterior tuberculum, thalamus and medulla oblongata. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing we generated a novel foxp2 zebrafish loss-of-function mutant that exhibits increased locomotor activity. Further, genetic and/or pharmacological disruption of Gad1 or GABA-A receptors causes increased locomotor activity, resembling the phenotype of foxp2 mutants. Application of muscimol, a GABA-A receptor agonist, rescues the hyperactive phenotype induced by the foxp2 loss-of-function. By reverse translation of the therapeutic effect on hyperactive behaviour exerted by methylphenidate, we note that application of methylphenidate evokes different responses in wildtype compared to foxp2 or gad1b loss-of-function animals. Together, our findings support the hypothesis that foxp2 regulates locomotor activity via GABAergic signalling. This provides one targetable mechanism, which may contribute to behavioural phenotypes commonly observed in NDDs."

The underlying neurobiology behind these differences is not well understood. To determine neurobiologic correlates of group differences in cortical thickness between cases and controls in 6 disorders: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and schizophrenia. Profiles of group differences in cortical thickness between cases and controls were generated using T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Similarity between interregional profiles of cell-specific gene expression and those in the group differences in cortical thickness were investigated in each disorder. Next, principal component analysis was used to reveal a shared profile of group difference in thickness across the disorders. Analysis for gene coexpression, clustering, and enrichment for genes associated with these disorders were conducted. Data analysis was conducted between June and December 2019. The analysis included 145 cohorts across 6 psychiatric disorders drawn from the ENIGMA consortium. The numbers of cases and controls in each of the 6 disorders were as follows: ADHD: 1814 and 1602; ASD: 1748 and 1770; BD: 1547 and 3405; MDD: 2658 and 3572; OCD: 2266 and 2007; and schizophrenia: 2688 and 3244. Interregional profiles of group difference in cortical thickness between cases and controls. A total of 12 721 cases and 15 600 controls, ranging from ages 2 to 89 years, were included in this study. Interregional profiles of group differences in cortical thickness for each of the 6 psychiatric disorders were associated with profiles of gene expression specific to pyramidal (CA1) cells, astrocytes (except for BD), and microglia (except for OCD); collectively, gene-expression profiles of the 3 cell types explain between 25% and 54% of variance in interregional profiles of group differences in cortical thickness. Principal component analysis revealed a shared profile of difference in cortical thickness across the 6 disorders (48% variance explained); interregional profile of this principal component 1 was associated with that of the pyramidal-cell gene expression (explaining 56% of interregional variation). Coexpression analyses of these genes revealed 2 clusters: (1) a prenatal cluster enriched with genes involved in neurodevelopmental (axon guidance) processes and (2) a postnatal cluster enriched with genes involved in synaptic activity and plasticity-related processes. These clusters were enriched with genes associated with all 6 psychiatric disorders. In this study, shared neurobiologic processes were associated with differences in cortical thickness across multiple psychiatric disorders. These processes implicate a common role of prenatal development and postnatal functioning of the cerebral cortex in these disorders."

A novel in situ hybridization protocol for rapid (15-30 min) chromosomal detection procedure and directly fluoresceinated DNA probes are recommended for use in mental retardation and congenital malformations. Chromosomal abnormalities could be detected in postnatal cases with chromosomal structural rearrangements, aneuplodies of gonosomes (including mosaicisms) and autosomes (including marker chromosomes). Molecular cytogenetics (or FISH diagnosis) can be used when classical cytogenetic methods are insufficient. The authors' experience shows that FISH should be utilized only as an adjunctive test for classical cytogenetic studies when banding techniques are ineffective; cytogenetic methods should be utilized for the preclinical diagnosis of Rett's syndrome. Detection by original probes gives an additional possibility in FISH analysis. Molecular cytogenetic methods are shown to provide a rapid accurate approach to studying and diagnosing chromosomal anomalies and disorders in mental retardation with congenital malformations and Rett's syndrome in children and to exploring aneuploidies in the postmortem cell samples from schizophrenic patients."

Women presenting for gynecologic cancer at an academic center during the course of 10 months were offered screening for depressive and anxiety symptoms. Patients were screened with the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders' Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General assessed well-being. Demographics, psychiatric history, and components about the cancer and treatment were collected. Those who screened positive with scores of 10 or higher on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 or the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 were offered a meeting with the study psychiatrist for further evaluation both with the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis as well as with an interview to discuss their experiences and to assess their desired needs. When family and social well-being was added to the logistic regression model, higher family and social well-being was the strongest factor associated with lower amounts of anxiety (odds ratio, 0.10; P = 0.001 for a cutoff of 10; odds ratio, 0.21; P = 0.012 for a cutoff of 8). Less than 30% who screened positive met with the study psychiatrist and were not receiving optimal treatment. Given that low family and social well-being and elevated anxiety symptoms were so highly correlated, those with anxiety symptoms would most benefit from social interventions. However, this study also found that patients with elevated depressive or anxiety symptoms were difficult to engage with a psychiatric provider. We need partnership between psychiatry and gynecology oncology to identify those with elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms and develop better ways to provide psychosocial supports."

Data were utilised from a population-based birth cohort: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Maternal depression symptoms were assessed repeatedly from pregnancy to child age 11 years. Offspring suicidal ideation was assessed at age 16 years. Using multiple imputation, data for 10,559 families were analysed. Using latent class growth analysis, five distinct classes of maternal depression symptoms were identified (minimal, mild, increasing, sub-threshold, chronic-severe). The prevalence of past-year suicidal ideation at age 16 years was 15% (95% CI: 14-17%). Compared to offspring of mothers with minimal symptoms, the greatest risk of suicidal ideation was found for offspring of mothers with chronic-severe symptoms [OR 3.04 (95% CI 2.19, 4.21)], with evidence for smaller increases in risk of suicidal ideation in offspring of mothers with sub-threshold, increasing and mild symptoms. These associations were not fully accounted for by maternal suicide attempt or offspring depression diagnosis. Twenty-six percent of non-depressed offspring of mothers with chronic-severe depression symptoms reported suicidal ideation. Risk for suicidal ideation should be considered in young people whose mothers have a history of sustained high levels of depression symptoms, even when the offspring themselves do not have a depression diagnosis."

        "title": "Differentiated Approach to Pharmacotherapy of Autism Spectrum Disorders: Biochemical Aspects.",
        "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders caused by a complex interaction of numerous genetic and environmental factors and leading to deviations in the nervous system formation at the very early developmental stages. Currently, there are no accepted pharmacological treatments for the so-called core symptoms of ASD, such as social communication disorders and restricted and repetitive behavior patterns. Lack of knowledge about biological basis of ASD, absence of the clinically significant biochemical parameters reflecting abnormalities in the signaling cascades controlling the nervous system development and functioning, and lack of methods for selection of clinically and biologically homogeneous subgroups are considered as causes for the failure of clinical trials of ASD pharmacotherapy. This review considers the possibilities of applying differentiated clinical and biological approaches to the targeted search for ASD pharmacotherapy with emphasis on biochemical markers associated with ASD and attempts to stratify patients by biochemical parameters. The use of such approach as \"the target-oriented therapy and assessment of the target status before and during the treatment to identify patients with a positive response to treatment\" is discussed using the published results of clinical trials as examples. It is concluded that identification of biochemical parameters for selection of the distinct subgroups among the ASD patients requires research on large samples reflecting clinical and biological diversity of the patients with ASD, and use of unified approaches for such studies. An integrated approach, including clinical observation, clinical-psychological assessment of the patient behavior, study of medical history and description of individual molecular profiles should become a new strategy for stratifying patients with ASD for clinical pharmacotherapeutic trials, as well as for evaluating their efficiency."

Two types of organic neuroses were distinguished: a conversive one--somatized hysteria (psychogenically determined subsyndromal hysterohypochondriac phobic or affective reactions with clear difference of algesic and autonomic disorders from symptoms of the somatic pathology, with polymorphism of the involved organic systems); and autonomic neurosis that is a central link in the structure of psychosomatic correlations, which, on the one hand, was overdone by clinical manifestations of the somatic pathology (mitral prolapse--35%, ventricular extrasystoles--12%, etc. in cardioneurosis, lymphoid hyperplasia of colonic mucosa--100%, dysbiopsis--10%, etc. in IBS); on the other hand, autonomic neurosis is a somatopsychic component of psychopathologic disorders of anxious-phobic, affective and hypochondriac sphere (panic disorder--59%, generalized anxiety--15%, anxious depression--18% in cardioneurosis, melancholic or hypochondriac cyclothymic depressions--76%, hypochondriac development--24% in IBS). Psychosomatic correlations were considered in autonomic neurosis in the context of some continuum, where somatic disorders amplified by functional disorders are on the one pole and true mental pathology including somatoautonomic disorders--on the other pole. Recommendations have been formulated on therapy of organic neuroses with anxiolytics, antidepressants and atypical neuroleptics in combination with somatotropic drugs."

        "abstract": "Morphology of the human cerebral cortex differs across psychiatric disorders, with neurobiology and developmental origins mostly undetermined. Deviations in the tangential growth of the cerebral cortex during pre/perinatal periods may be reflected in individual variations in cortical surface area later in life. Interregional profiles of group differences in surface area between cases and controls were generated using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging from 27,359 individuals including those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and high general psychopathology (through the Child Behavior Checklist). Similarity of interregional profiles of group differences in surface area and prenatal cell-specific gene expression was assessed. Across the 11 cortical regions, group differences in cortical area for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and Child Behavior Checklist were dominant in multimodal association cortices. The same interregional profiles were also associated with interregional profiles of (prenatal) gene expression specific to proliferative cells, namely radial glia and intermediate progenitor cells (greater expression, larger difference), as well as differentiated cells, namely excitatory neurons and endothelial and mural cells (greater expression, smaller difference). Finally, these cell types were implicated in known pre/perinatal risk factors for psychosis. Genes coexpressed with radial glia were enriched with genes implicated in congenital abnormalities, birth weight, hypoxia, and starvation. Genes coexpressed with endothelial and mural genes were enriched with genes associated with maternal hypertension and preterm birth. Our findings support a neurodevelopmental model of vulnerability to mental illness whereby prenatal risk factors acting through cell-specific processes lead to deviations from typical brain development during pregnancy."

        "abstract": "Previous studies have highlighted risks for depression and suicide in medical cohorts, but evidence regarding psychiatric residents is missing. This study aimed to determine rates of depression, suicide ideation and suicide attempt among psychiatric residents and to identify associated individual, educational and work-related risk factors. A total of 1980 residents from 22 countries completed the online survey which collected data on depression (PHQ-9), suicidality (SIBQ), socio-demographic profiles, training, and education. Generalized linear modeling and logistic regression analysis were used to predict depression and suicide ideation, respectively. The vast majority of residents did not report depression, suicide ideation or attempting suicide during psychiatric training. Approximately 15% (n = 280) of residents met criteria for depression, 12.3% (n = 225) reported active suicide ideation, and 0.7% (n = 12) attempted suicide during the training. Long working hours and no clinical supervision were associated with depression, while more completed years of training and lack of other postgraduate education (e.g. PhD or psychotherapy training) were associated with increased risk for suicide ideation during psychiatric training. Being single and female was associated with worse mental health during training. Due to the cross-sectional nature of the study, results should be confirmed by longitudinal studies. Response rate was variable but the outcome variables did not statistically significantly differ between countries with response rates of more or less than 50%. Depression rates among psychiatric residents in this study were lower than previously reported data, while suicide ideation rates were similar to previous reports. Poor working and training conditions were associated with worse outcomes. Training programmes should include effective help for residents experiencing mental health problems so that they could progress through their career to the benefit of their patients and wider society."

The study sample included 23 cases with manifestations resembling the clinical presentation of allergic dermatoses and skin symptoms of allergic diseases with no signs of somatic-related allergic sets of symptoms (medical history/laboratory studies). The patients were examined using clinical, laboratory, and psychometric methods followed by statistical data processing. There are two types of functional activity of pseudoallergic reactions: \"amplification\" and \"overlap\" of clinical manifestations of schizotypal personality disorder. In accordance with the hypothesis based on the data obtained, pseudoallergy refers to adaptive dimensions (a marker of endogenous process stabilization), ensuring the stability of manifestations of schizotypal personality disorder as a part of latent schizophrenia. To confirm the hypothesis, modern neurobiological and genetic research data were used. From the point of view of clinical practice, pseudoallergy is a severe psychosomatic disorder that requires multidisciplinary specialized care with the involvement of allergologists-immunologists and psychiatrists focused on psychosomatic medicine."

As many human brain diseases are based on complex interplay between the neural and the immune system, here we discuss zebrafish models, as well as recent successes and challenges, in this rapidly expanding field. We particularly emphasize the growing utility of zebrafish models in translational immunopsychiatry research, as they improve our understanding of pathogenetic neuro-immune interactions, thereby fostering future discovery of potential therapeutic agents."

        "abstract": "To identify the features of the cognitive status in patients with cardiac surgery profile with senile asthenia syndrome (SAS) and preasthenia. A study included 272 patients admitted for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Screening for preasthenia and SAS in patients before surgery was performed using the Brief Battery of Physical Functioning Tests. SAS and preasthenia were detected in 15% of patients (<i>n</i>=41). Seventy-five patients were selected in the comparison group without asthenia. Assessment of the state of cognitive functions was carried out using screening neuropsychological scales - the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The median of the MMSE score (27 [26; 28] and 28 [27; 29], <i>p</i>=0.04), and the MoCA score (23 [19; 25] and 25 [23; 27], <i>p</i>=0.0085) was significantly lower in patients with asthenia and pre-asthenia compared to patients without asthenia. According to the MoCA, about 60% of patients in the pre-asthenia-asthenia group had severe cognitive impairment, while in the group without asthenia, more than 30% of cases had normal cognitive functions (<i>p</i>=0.003). Significant intergroup differences were found in MoCA subtests, reflecting visuospatial skills, abstraction, verbal fluency and working memory (<i>p</i>=0.01-0.04). Regression analysis showed that age and physical functioning index (severity of asthenia) most significantly contributed to the basic cognitive status assessed by MoCA. Features of the cognitive status in patients of cardiac surgery with the SAS and preasthenia are impairments of visuospatial thinking, verbal fluency, abstract thinking and working memory. The MoCA was shown to be informative in determining the basic cognitive status of cardiac surgical patients. At the same time, the greatest contribution to the basic cognitive status is made by age and the indicator of physical functioning, which characterizes the degree of asthenia."

        "abstract": "The aging of the population and the associated increase in the share of cognitive impairments in the structure of a wide range of diseases are a serious challenge for modern healthcare. Difficulties in the treatment of cognitive disorders are determined by many factors, including the age of patients, comorbidity, forced polypragmasia and the adequacy of the dosage of drugs that restore cognitive activity. The experts discussed information about the therapeutic potential of the drug Cerebrolysin in the treatment of cognitive disorders of various origins, stated significant experience of its effective and safe use in many clinical studies in mild and moderate forms of dementia. At the same time, there was a lack of consistent and systematic data on the dosage regimen, frequency, and duration of use of the drug in different forms of cognitive impairment and the degree of their severity. The aim of the international council of experts was to determine the optimal dosage regimens of the drug Cerebrolysin in patients with various etiologies and severity of cognitive impairment. The result of the work was the approval of a unified scheme for the use of the drug Cerebrolysin, considering the severity of the disease and its duration."

In the current investigation we attempted to undertake further study of such association using an extended sample which comprised patients with schizophrenia (n = 184), schizoaffective psychosis (n = 63), affective disorders (n = 121)); healthy control subjects (n = 117) and first-degree relatives of the patients with psychoses who show no signs of mental diseases (n = 111). The genotypes A1A1, A1A2 and A2A2 and the relationship between Taq1DRD2 variants and some clinical symptoms and pathogenetic features of the patients with schizophrenia were studied. The results did not confirm the association between DRD2 genotype and any of disorders studied. But the A2A2 genotype frequency in the schizophrenic patient's group, with illness duration above 20 years and highly expressed positive, negative and psychopathological symptoms, increased significantly as compared to control group (73.7% vs 52.9%) and patients with less illness duration (73.7% vs 42.5%). In the latter case odds ratio was calculated as 4.12. In the light of this finding, A2A2 DRD2 genotype appears to be related to chronicity of schizophrenia."

A study was also made of factors promoting the occurrence of neuroses as well as of those favouring the recovery from neuroses. In accordance with the data obtained, the number of neurotic patients registered at the dispensary turned out 4 times less on the average as compared to that identified among the community. Analysis of the medical services rendered to the rural community suffering from neuroses has demonstrated that these services require material improvement. It is emphasized that the improvement of the medical aid rendered to the neurotic patients living in the country should be exercised at the expense of the already available services (rural ambulatory centers, doctor's assistant and midwifery stations) of the general somatic network rather that at the expense of the enlargement of the psychiatry services network."

        "abstract": "Severe irritability has become an important topic in child and adolescent mental health. Based on the available evidence and on public health considerations, WHO classified chronic irritability within oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in ICD-11, a solution markedly different from DSM-5's (i.e. the new childhood mood diagnosis, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [DMDD]) and from ICD-10's (i.e. ODD as one of several conduct disorders without attention to irritability). In this study, we tested the accuracy with which a global, multilingual, multidisciplinary sample of clinicians were able to use the ICD-11 classification of chronic irritability and oppositionality as compared to the ICD-10 and DSM-5 approaches. Clinicians (N = 196) from 48 countries participated in an Internet-based field study in English, Spanish, or Japanese and were randomized to review and use one of the three diagnostic systems. Through experimental manipulation of validated clinical vignettes, we evaluated how well clinicians in each condition could identify chronic irritability versus nonirritable oppositionality, episodic bipolar disorder, dysthymic depression, and normative irritability. Compared to ICD-10 and DSM-5, ICD-11 led to more accurate identification of severe irritability and better differentiation from boundary presentations. Participants using DSM-5 largely failed to apply the DMDD diagnosis when it was appropriate, and they more often applied psychopathological diagnoses to developmentally normative irritability. The formulation of irritability and oppositionality put forth in ICD-11 shows evidence of clinical utility, supporting accurate diagnosis. Global mental health clinicians can readily identify ODD both with and without chronic irritability."

We investigated the possible association of psychomotor symptoms (PMSs) during a MDE with clinical features belonging to the bipolar spectrum. The initial sample of 7689 MDE patients was divided into three subgroups based on the presence of PR, PA and non-psychomotor symptom (NPS). Univariate comparisons and multivariate logistic regression models were performed between subgroups. A total of 3720 patients presented PR (48%), 1971 showed PA (26%) and 1998 had NPS (26%). In the PR and PA subgroups, the clinical characteristics related to bipolarity, along with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD), were significantly more frequent than in the NPS subgroup. When comparing PA and PR patients, the former presented higher rates of bipolar spectrum features, such as family history of BD (OR = 1.39, CI = 1.20-1.61), manic/hypomanic switches with antidepressants (OR = 1.28, CI = 1.11-1.48), early onset of first MDE (OR = 1.40, CI = 1.26-1.57), atypical (OR = 1.23, CI = 1.07-1.42) and psychotic features (OR = 2.08, CI = 1.78-2.44), treatment with mood-stabilizers (OR = 1.39, CI = 1.24-1.55), as well as a BD diagnosis according to both the DSM-IV criteria and the bipolar specifier criteria. When logistic regression model was performed, the clinical features that significantly differentiated PA from PR were early onset of first MDE, atypical and psychotic features, treatment with mood-stabilizers and a BD diagnosis according to the bipolar specifier criteria. Psychomotor symptoms could be considered as markers of bipolarity, illness severity, and treatment complexity, particularly if PA is present."

        "abstract": "The authors examined 128 male adolescents admitted to a psychiatric hospital for the psychopathlike syndrome free of psychotic manifestations which was associated with the abnormal rate of sexual development. A correlation was established between the maturation rate, plasma testosterone levels and clinical features of behavioural abnormalities. Retarded puberty was related to decreased testosterone concentrations throughout the pubertal period. In cases of accelerated development the testosterone content was increased at the age of 14-15 years, i.e. in the period of the most intensive maturation; later on, in the process of reaching puberty, the hormone level approaches the age specific rate. The clinical picture of behavioural disorders in the presence of retarded or accelerated development depends on whether the symptoms caused by abnormal rates of maturation were combined with the symptoms of cerebral insufficiency. Adolescents with accelerated development unattended by cerebral insufficiency manifestations were characterized by marked aggression and an increase in desires. Depending on the degree of activity, asthenic nature, leadership capacities and the level of intellect, they are divided into two clinical variants: epileptoid and conformational-epileptoid types of accentuations. Cerebral insufficiency was reflected in the form of lowered intellect, explosiveness and impaired desires in the clinical picture of both accelerated and retarded pubertal development."

In the presented clinical case, a patient (35 years old) with a 10-year history of type 1 diabetes mellitus intentionally refuses regular insulin administration in order to reduce body weight. The psychopathological qualification of the phenomenon underlying the ED presented as diabulimia in this patient corresponds to grandiose notions as part of schizotypal disorder (F21). The peculiarity of the condition in this clinical case is that the grandiose notion of weight loss was observed before the manifestation of type 1 diabetes mellitus, and later, it was included in the structure of the internal presentation of the disease (endocrinopathy), led to manipulations with insulin therapy, which in turn resulted in late complications of diabetes."

The level of metal-ion-catalyzed oxidation proteins in the aged patients both with and without dementia was high in comparison to the healthy adults. The patients with severe dementia showed lower amount of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone deriviates. Low levels of metal-ion-catalysed protein oxidation strongly correlated with the degree of psychoorganic disturbances. The elderly persons with both and without dementia showed a high level of plasma nonenzymatic H2O2 scavenging in comparison with the healthy adult ones. We discovered an imbalance between enzymatic and nonenzymatic components of the antioxidant system.

Three types of nosogenic reactions in CHF have been identifiedSignificantly more frequent were dissociative reactions (76 (62.8%) patients, 40 men, 36 women, mean age 64.4±12.7) with an underestimation of the severity of the somatic condition, which formed in CHF with a short (3.2±3.8 years, <i>p</i><0.05), but the most severe course. They were associated with hyperthymic, hysterical and schizoid personality radical. Hypochondriacal reactions (28 (23.1%) patients, 18 men, 20 women, mean age 63.4±15.2), due to anxiety about health and excessive fixation on the functioning of the heart, were characteristic of CHF, regardless of the severity of cardiological conditions, with an average duration of the course (4.1±4.2 years). They were observed in patients with anxious and hysterical radicals. Depressive reactions (17 (14%) patients, 8 men, 9 women, mean age 64.3±13.5), had the most protracted character (6.1±3.2 years), formed in patients with anankastic and schizoid radicals, and were noted in chronic heart failure with a long course and moderate severity. Heterogeneous nosogenic reactions in CHF were associated with low adherence to treatment due to maladaptive behavior of the patient, determined by the characteristics of the psychopathological structure.

The population includes three subpopulations: a small old religious semi-isolate of Russians (\"Rs\"), aboriginal Komi people (\"Ks\")--an ethnic community of Ugro-Finnish lineage, and a mixed group of migrants (\"Ms\") from various regions of the USSR. The latter is mainly an urban population, while the \"Rs\" and \"Ks\" are, on the whole, rural populations. The total PR for EFP was found to be 0.97% for the \"Rs\", 0.63% for the \"Ks\" and 0.35% for the \"Ms\", whereas PRs-0.85-1.15% in other parts of the USSR, mainly for \"panmixed\" populations in large towns. The lower PRs for EFP in the \"Ms\" is caused by a backmigration flow involving certain groups of patients; consequently, the mean liability for \"Ms\" offsprings (as a whole) should also be lower. On the other hand, the lower PRs for EFP in the \"Ks\" is caused by underpresentation of clinically mild cases of the mental disease (mainly, pseudoneurotic schizophrenia), especially among female patients, probably due to that the so affected persons are sufficiently adapted to the cultural traditions of this rural population. It was shown that in the \"Rs\" the total PR for \"nuclear\" and paranoid schizophrenia is 0.68% versus 0.25% in a \"panmixed\" population. The increase is most likely caused by the high inbreeding level in the \"Rs\" semi-isolate, and if this is correct, we may suppose that at least one or two recessive genes are involved in the liability to the most heavy forms of schizophrenia. On the other hand, in the \"Ms\" (as in other \"panmixed\" populations) positive assortative mating among hereditary-predisposed persons is a more significant factor influencing family transmission of EFP, since the correlation between probands and their spouses is rpp = 0.31 (p less than 0.001) in the \"Ms\", as compared to rpp = 0.19 (p less than 0.1) in the \"Rs\". Thus, our general conclusion is that neither the place of inhabitance nor the life mode are the causal factors for EFP, but rather some genetic factors, more accurately, certain sets of specific genes."
