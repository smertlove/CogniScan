        "abstract": "Al igual que los adultos normales, los sujetos con trastornos del espectro autista (TEA) presentan toda la gama de conductas sexuales. Sin embargo, debido a los síntomas centrales del espectro del trastorno, que incluyen déficits en las destrezas sociales, hiper e hipo sensibilidad sensorial y conductas repetitivas, algunos sujetos con TEA pueden desarrollar intereses y conductas sexuales hipernormales o no habituales. Se revisa la literatura más relevante sobre la sexualidad en sujetos con TEA de alto funcionamiento y se presentan los nuevos hallazgos provenientes de los estudios del grupo de trabajo sobre la frecuencia de las conductas sexuales normales y sobre la evaluación de las conductas y fantasías hipersexuales y parafílicas. Al parecer los sujetos con TEA tienen más conductas y fantasías hipersexuales y parafílicas que lo sugerido por estudios en población general. Sin embargo, esta inconsistencia se debe principalmente a las observaciones realizadas en los hombres con TEA. Esto podría deberse al hecho que las mujeres con TEA están más adaptadas socialmente y presentan menos síntomas del TEA. Las peculiaridades en la conducta sexual de los pacientes con TEA deben ser tomadas en cuenta para la educación sexual y en los abordajes terapéuticos."

        "abstract": "Using attitudinal, behavorial, and physiological measures, the effects of cyproterone acetate and ethinyl estradiol on the sexual behavior of sexual offenders was assessed. The effects of the drugs did not differ significantly on any measure. Compared to no treatment, both drugs lowered sexual interest and sexual activity. Sexual attitudes were not changed. No important side effects were noted. These studies do not indicate what long-term side effects might be expected. Further research will be needed to determine these. Since estrogens carry the risk of serious and irreversible side effects, cyproterone acetate seems to be more desirable for controlling sexual behavior."

        "abstract": "The prevalence of genital actinomyces infection and possible routes of transmission in IUD users were analyzed in a high-risk population of predominantly indigent Mexican-American family planning clients. The Papanicolaou (Pap) smears of 12 (9%) of the 134 IUD users cultured were positive for actinomyces-like organisms. The IUD involved was the Lippes Loop in 7 cases, the Cu 7 in 2 women, the Dalkon Shield in another 2 cases, and the Saf-T-Coil in the final case. The duration of IUD use ranged from 1-10 years, with a mean of 6 years. Oral-genital sexual contact was the sexual preference in 3/4 of the women with actinomyces infection compared with under 2/3 of the general clinic population. Most of the women with actinomyces-like organisms had a concomitant condition, including gastroenteritis, cholecystitis, scabies, schizophrenia, drug abuse, anemia, herpes genitalis, venereal disease, and urinary tract infection. All of these women complained of vaginal discharge with pelvic pain during their initial visits. Eikenella corrodens was recovered in 1 of these cases and had an overall prevalence of 0.17% in the clinic population. Eikenella corrodens is found in the mouth, on dental plaques, and is not yet recognized as a normal inhabitant of the vagina or gastrointestinal tract. Oral-genital contact appears to be the mode of transmission of both actinomyces and Eikenella corrodens."

        "abstract": "An AIDS education project in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil has enabled male sex workers to discuss safe sex, sexual preference, and self-worth. The project, known as Pegacao (\"Cruising\"), is designed to establish personal contact with the male prostitutes. The educators most of whom are openly homosexual, and some of whom are former sex workers, operate out of 4 outposts in the city. In one such outpost, a popular restaurant, the educators wait for male sex workers (Miches, as they are called) to come and talk. The Miches come from several reasons. Some come to talk about life, other about sexuality, and others want to help in contacting a doctor or a psychologist. Pegacao now has contact with some 400-600 male prostitutes aged 14-23. Since most of the male prostitutes are illiterate, the education is based on discussion, not on printed materials. The discussions focus primarily on sexuality and sexual practices. Many of the Miches, who often come from the poor families, say that they are involved in prostitution as a temporary way of earning money. Most deny being homosexual, and many say that they have girlfriends and are thinking about getting married. The educators, however, suspect that many Miches hide their sexual preferenced and use prostitution as a way to express their repressed homosexuality. While the Miches admit penetrating their clients (identifying it with the \"male\" role), few acknowledge being penetrated (the \"female\" or \"gay\" role). But the high rate of sexually acquired infections in the rectum suggest that the Miches are engaging in receptive, unprotected anal intercourse more often that they care to admit. In addition to teaching them about safe sex, the educators try to help Miches develop a positive attitude towards their sexuality and develop a sense of self-worth."

The 3 males, ages 20, 30, and 16, were treated with 300 mg of Depo-Provera every 10 days; after 1 month of treatment their plasma testosterone levels dropped from 461, 810, and 760 to 28, 110, and 207 ngs%, respectively. The 2 married men initially reported loss of energy but this complaint left them within a few weeks. They were able to continue sexual relations with their spouses to a satisfactory degree. The 16-year-old claimed that he had no interest in sex and no longer masturbated. All 3 were quite pleased with the results of the treatment, both with regard to the defusing of their destructive sexual energy and the concomitant mellowing of their temperaments. It is concluded that this new therapeutic opportunity must be promulgated so that families, judges, and others who were previously without hope may extend that hope to the smallggroup of now treatable patients."

        "abstract": "This paper summarizes what is known about adolescent sexual behavior in the 1980s. One study found that 85% of American teens have had a boyfriend or girlfriend. Overall, 43% of teens have participated in vaginal play and 40% have experienced penile manipulation. A significant number of teenagers report having participated in oral sex. Many adolescents also report that they masturbate. Surveys of American adolescents have found that, on the whole, average age at 1st intercourse ranges from 16 to 16.9 years, but some teenagers begin to have intercourse shortly after puberty. The proportion of sexually-experienced teens increases with age. Many adolescents see their 1st experience sexual intercourse as a conscious, personal choice. At all ages, males are more likely to report having had intercourse than are females. Many adolescents who have had intercourse report regular contraceptive use. More than 1/3 (33%-39%) report contraceptive use every time they engage in intercourse. However, a large number of sexually experienced teenagers use contraception irregularly. Teenagers who have had intercourse express a preference for birth control pills over condoms as their primary means of contraception. Inconsistent contraceptive use among teens is reflected in the number of adolescent pregnancies in the US each year. In 1984, there were 233 adolescent pregnancies/1000 sexually active 15-19-year-old females. A large share of adolescent pregnancies end in abortion. 1 in 7 teens contracts a sexually transmitted disease each year. Many believe that teens are at high risk of infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) because of poorly protected sexual experimentation and intravenous drug use. Healthy adult sexuality may depend a great deal on the earlier years of sexual development."

        "abstract": "The Irish court granted a decree of nullity to the applicant husband on the grounds that his marriage was doomed from the outset because of immaturity of character and temperament on the part of both parties and an incapacity to form and sustain a normal marriage relationship. The couple had cohabited and the wife contested the request for a decree of nullity. The court rejected the argument that a petitioner could not rely on the grounds of his own incapacity when the other party has not repudiated the marriage. Other High Court opinions in 1989 held the following with respect to nullity: 1) a marriage can be annulled on the ground of lack of consent when the wife marries because of professional and personal difficulties that her pregnancy would present if she did not marry and because of incapacity to form and sustain a normal marriage relationship when the husband suffers from a gross personality disorder leaving him unable to form any meaningful marriage relationship (W.[C.] v. C, 17 February 1989, Irish Law Times, August 1989, p. 178); 2) a marriage cannot be annulled on the grounds of duress when the husband shows only that he feared legal action if he did not marry his fiance and was suffering no mental illness (O'S. v. W[O'S], 25 July 1989, Irish Law Times, September 1990, p. 195); and 3) a marriage cannot be annulled on the ground of incapacity to enter into and sustain a normal marriage relationship as evidenced by the homosexual nature of the husband if there is no mental illness present (U.F.

        "abstract": "Although people have linked HIV and AIDS with homosexuality ever since HIV appeared in the Western world, studies show that sexual orientation is relatively unimportant in the transmission of HIV. AIDS is becoming more and more an heterosexual phenomenon. Studies show that perceived differences between the practices of heterosexual and homosexual couples are inaccurate. For example, an estimated 75% of heterosexual couples engage in oral sex, exactly the same percentage as has been reported in male homosexual couples. Many heterosexual couples also practice anal intercourse on one or another occasion, but less frequently than do homosexual couples. Of homosexual and bisexual men over age 20, almost all reported having had approximately 20 same-sex partners. In a sample of 1450 men, only two reported having had 100 or more partners. 55% of heterosexually active male adult Americans report having had up to 20 partners and 25% have had more than 20 partners. These statistics confound the myth that homosexual men have excessive sexual appetites. Developed countries will eventually mirror the heterosexual incidence profiles of developing countries, albeit at a much lower level. By 1992, 128,500 women and 1,038,500 men in the US were estimated to be HIV-seropositive, although the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that year reported that the number of women developing AIDS in the US was four times greater than men. These figures support the need to focus upon all types of sexual behavior in order to prevent HIV infection. Future research must consider the practices and needs of homosexuals, heterosexuals, and bisexuals. Furthermore, sexual orientation should be regarded as a psychosocially normal, non-pathological behavior pattern and not be singled out as an abnormal factor. With regard to HIV transmission and sexual behavior, distinction should also not be made between racial groups."

I feed sad, really sad, about the cases of men and women who engage in unprotected (without condoms) extra-marital sex and then wait for 2 to 3 weeks before they have sex with their spouses in the belief that, if they have no problems in the meantime, they must be free of infection. They are unaware that it is possible to harbor Neisseria gonorrhoea and other STD organisms in the genital system without having symptoms. Studies have shown that 10% of men and 60% of women infected with N. gonorrhoea have no symptoms. Some who resume a sexual relationship with their spouse after the 2 to 3 week 'watchful period' pass on an infection and then blame their innocent spouse for the consequences] We should seek to improve the knowledge of the public and to disabuse their faith in the watchful period. Another area where action is required concerns herpes genitals. Many doctors are not familiar with atypical presentations of this infection and, consequently, many cases are missed. In view of the importance of early detection and early commencement of therapy with acyclovir (Zovirax), I call upon Wellcome--as manufacturers of Zovirax--to publish and distribute in Africa a chart illustrating the various presentations of the infection. This would help prevent doctors from making such patients go from antibiotic to antibiotic for many months without cure. (full text)."

Similarly, orgasm is said to be unchanged, improved in 32%, or improved in several respects in another study. Frigidity is reported in 5 and 6% in 2 rigorous studies, and in 30% in a placebo study. In contrast, dysmenorrhea and premenstrual syndrome are usually improved due to inhibition of ovulation. The author found that 9% of his patients questioned complained of painful penetration, 3% during and 9% after intercourse, probably because of mycoses and insufficient vaginal lubrication. 1 proven effect of the pill is a mild to severe deficiency of Vitamin-B6, causing depression, irritability, and loss of libido. Research in monkeys shows that female pheromones are dependent on natural hormone levels. Finally, the symbolic significance of taking a contraceptive pill, and the fact that a particular population of women will select this type of contraception, may lead to a predisposition to sexual behavior problems. Giving Vitamin-B6 to women with associated depression, searching for vaginal infection in those with complaints of dyspareunia, and changing the pill usually to a lower dose, in cases of general malaise, are suggested."

Unlike the situation in the US and most of Europe, where HIV infection is found primarily among homosexual and bisexual men, intravenous drug users account for 66% of the hiv cases in Italy. This study, which ran from January through March of 1990, involved interviews with 124 IV heroin users having methadone treatment in a Public Assistance Center in Rome. The goals of the study included conducting a demographic survey and investigation of the serological condition of IVDUs, investigating the sexual behavior of both HIV positive and negative subjects, and investigating any changes in the sexual habits of the subjects following awareness of their serological condition. 34 of those interviewed were women and 90 were men. Ages ranged from 18-41 years. Of the 124 subjects, 120 were heterosexual, 2 homosexual, and 2 bisexual. 39 heterosexuals, as well as the 2 homosexuals and the 2 bisexuals, tested HIV positive. 96% of the IVDUs interviewed reported being sexually active, and 67% indicated having at least 1 sexual intercourse a week (28% reported 10 or less sexual intercourses in a year). Although all those interviewed acknowledged being aware of the risk of sexually transmitted AIDS, 60% of the HIV positive and 88% of the HIV negative subjects did not use condoms regularly (56% of the HIV negative subjects never used condoms). The article lists some of the reasons given for irregular use of condoms. Concerning changes in sexual habits, 46% of the HIV negative and 63% of the HIV positive subjects indicated reducing the number of sexual partners and/or using condoms."

        "abstract": "This paper presents field research on the major ethical problems in the study of male homosexuality in Mexico from 1968 up to the present and describes a solution to these problems. Ethical concerns about the psychological and social well-being of respondents are heightened in when the focus of a study is on a highly private, sensitive and sanctioned human behavior such as sexual relations. The ethics of a gay man conducting participant observation studies of male homosexuality tend particularly to be open to special scrutiny and suspicion. Most of the major ethical concerns about the study of male homosexuality are related to 1) the methods used by the researcher to collect participant-observation and interview data and 2) the possibility that the dissemination of study findings by the researcher to the outside world may lead to unwanted adverse effects on project respondents and on the population they represent. The use of the participant-observer in gathering of data in the field presents a serious ethical problem that must be addressed by sex researchers. Thus, future researchers contemplating ethnographic participant observation studies in the field must take into account the reality that it is extremely unlikely that they will be able to separate their private sex lives completely from their research."

All STD patients attending the private clinic of a senior dermatologist and venereologist in Varanasi during a 6-month period were interviewed. There were 54 men and 6 women of mean age 27.5 years in the range of 18-52. 40 of the men were younger than age 30 years, while most patients had contracted infection from prostitutes. A fair number of more casual contacts were also reported. Infections among males came from known prostitutes in 22 cases, girlfriends in 13, relatives in 10, and a neighbor in 9. 69% of the men were married, with 40.6% of these men living with their wives at the time of exposure. Viral STDs such as herpes genitalis were common. 20 of the men consulted a qualified venereologist after the first exposure to infection. Indigenous \"gupt rog\" specialists in sexual medicine attracted the second largest number of patients after first exposure. On subsequent visit, however, none of the men returned to a gupt rog specialist. Good compliance as in the case of primary syphilis, gonorrhea, and non-gonococcal urethritis was probably due to good symptomatic response. Poor compliance in the case of herpes genitalis was probably the result of recurrence and inconvenient treatment regimens."

This paper brings together data from qualitative research carried out in Pattaya and Bangkok, with data generated during a bar-based intervention in Bangkok, to develop a taxonomy of sites in which the recruitment of male commercial sex can occur. The researchers also examined the sexual networks of Thai male sex workers and their clients in order to show the overlap of commercial and non-commercial male-male sex sites, and the intersection of male commercial sex with heterosexual sex. Previous efforts directed towards Thai male sex workers have been non-continuous; largely restricted to high-profile tourist areas; have not acknowledged the importance of recreational sex; and have not built up a capacity for ongoing intervention. With a change of focus, interventions targeted at sex workers could reduce the risks of HIV infection among organized and freelance sex workers as well as their commercial and male and female casual sex partners. Foremost, however, is the need to commit to well planned and long range interventions directed by and at male sex workers."

Health workers need to be prepared to talk with people about sexual issues. Workers need basic information about recognizing and treating sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and preventing HIV infections. Workers should have a comfortable and open manner when talking about sexuality. Workers need communication and counseling skills. In order to dispel uneasiness about talking about personal sexual experiences, workers should ask whether single sex or mixed sex groups are preferred. Workers should assure that sessions are confidential. Workers need to acknowledge their embarrassment about talking about sensitive issues and ask discussants permission before embarking on opening up sensitive topics. Explicit language and a direct approach are preferred over polite language. Two exercises are described. One requests participants to provide local sexual terms. The other activity is role playing between two people. Workers should place an emphasis on positive and negative meanings of terms and ask participants about how they feel about the use of specific sexual terms. Role playing is used to help people become more familiar with difficult subjects. An example is given of a five-minute role play about the meaning of safer sex. Participants revealed their worries about potential pregnancy and the possibility of condoms breaking. Suggestions are made to begin discussions with a skit, pictures, or stories."

There is in Zimbabwe, however, a high rate of sexually transmitted diseases and a rapidly growing AIDS epidemic, with 1148 AIDS cases already having been officially reported. It is estimated that approximately 5% of adult men and women may be infected with HIV in some urban areas. In this context, many women fear that their husbands may infect them with HIV. A woman who insists that her husband use a condom is, however, either told by the man that he wants to impregnate her, accused of being sexually unfaithful, or hit for accusing the man of being sexually unfaithful. Several men who have developed AIDS have even accused their wives of bewitching them out of jealousy and sent them back to their homes. The Women's AIDS Support Network held its first meeting in November 1989 for the purpose of helping women gain confidence to fight AIDS in a society where they have little control over the sexual behavior of men.

To that end, the Indian Health Organization, a nongovernmental organization founded 11 years ago in Bombay, is promoting the teachings of the Kama Sutra as an alternative to condom use in preventing HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. The basic message that sex with one partner in many positions is safer than sex in one position with many partners is proclaimed on T-shirts and in a series of explicit postcards. This approach is promoting openness, communication, and equality between the sexes."

The study was able to gather information on the sexual experiences of men, the good and the bad, their fears about AIDS and on their sexual pleasures. These men also talked about their ambivalence towards the use of condom and their experiences with sexually transmitted diseases. The study was able to identify several factors influencing men¿s sexual attitudes and practices. It was observed that different cultures show different sexual behaviors, influenced by the social environment. The researchers accommodated these differences and designed the programs to fit the social network of the people concerned."

        "abstract": "HIV is largely transmitted through sexual contact. Engaging in sexual activities and contact with little to no risk of HIV transmission therefore reduces the spread of HIV. AIDSTECH has worked in 45 countries, focusing upon strategies for changing sexual behavior with the goal of checking the spread of HIV. Focus is given to targeted intervention programs designed to reduce the sexual transmission of HIV among people at greatest risk of infection. Programs involve peer education, clinic-based projects, and reaching men at work and in social settings. Condom promotion and distribution, designing effective AIDS education materials, and evaluating the effectiveness of intervention projects are integral to program efforts. Gaining government support for such interventions can be crucial to success at both the national and local levels. AIDSTECH's programs must be replicated, expanded, and sustained in target communities throughout the developing world in order to achieve some measure of success against the HIV/AIDS pandemic."

South Africa is the only country to distribute condoms in prisons. In Togo and Guinea, condoms are sold in prison hospitals. Indicative of the prevailing attitude was a comment made by the head of the detention center in Dakar: \"If we introduce condoms into prisons, we are inviting prisoners to do what we otherwise forbid them to do.\""

Many homosexuals adopt heterosexual lifestyles in an attempt to fit in. In Kenya, where homosexuality is illegal, sex between men (or between men and boys) is estimated to cause less than 5% of the cases of HIV/AIDS. The head of the Kenya AIDS NGO (nongovernmental organization) Consortium reports that male homosexuality is fashionable among young men and is practiced in prisons, boarding schools, and colleges. While homosexuals meet publicly in a building near the University of Nairobi, most homosexuals lead a clandestine sex life. In the coastal regions of Kenya, however, male homosexuality is more accepted, and marriages between men may be recognized. No one knows the extent to which the wives of homosexual men face the risk of HIV/AIDS from their husbands' homosexual behavior. The taboos surrounding homosexuality impede the provision of AIDS education and support, and there is no official recognition of the role homosexuals play in transmitting the virus. A representative of the Ministry of Health contends that HIV/AIDS transmission by homosexuals is so negligible that it does not justify attention."

        "abstract": "The number of persons with drug induced sexual dysfunction has risen simultaneously with the unending increase in the number of commercially available drugs. Sexual dysfunction may seriously impair the human psyche. Patients do not often admit to sexual dysfunction, however, so physicians often miss the symptoms entirely. In addition, they may attribute them to other causes, such as depression. Drugs disrupt all 3 neurophysiologic phases of sexual response (desire, excitement, and orgasm), especially in men, either causing a decrease or loss of libido, impotence (the most common symptom), or failure of ejaculation or anorgasmia. The mechanisms involved are not well understood. Researchers do know, however, that the drug cimetidine (Tagamet) blocks androgen receptors, decreases testosterone synthesis, and induces higher circulating levels of estradiol resulting in impotence and breast enlargement in men. Antihypertensive drugs have a higher frequency of causing sexual dysfunction, particularly impotence, than other drugs. Some also induce or worsen depression that can in turn cause or intensify sexual dysfunction. Both legal and illegal psychoactive drugs act on multiple sites thus often stimulating sexual dysfunction. Further, some hormonal drugs also induce sexual side effects, such as norethindrone and progesterone. Physicians who prescribe a drug associated with sexual side effects should inform patients about their possible occurrence and recommend that they be aware of the symptoms. They should ask these patients do not usually offer this information themselves. If sexual dysfunction develops, physicians can reduce the dosage or switch to an alternative drug. At that time, they should express optimism that the sexual dysfunction will cease."

Although participants noted the lack of accessibility to women as the main reason for such behavior, the overwhelming majority of these men who have sex with men were married. Those aged 14-16 years had an average of 2 sex partners per year, while those aged 17-20 had 5, those aged 21-35 had 42, and those aged 36-45 had 35. There are many anecdotal reports of young men in South Asia who have sex with men and/or women in exchange for money or other tangible goods. By early 1997, 1232 cases of HIV infection had been reported in Pakistan, of which 88.4% were in men. These data come from the National AIDS Program, and consist largely of cases reported from 4 provinces. While the mode of HIV transmission was not recorded in 41% of cases, male-male sex was the acknowledged mode of transmission among 3.2% of HIV-positive men. Male-male sex appears to exist among married men who have extramarital sex contacts, prisoners, seafarers, IV drug users, truck drivers, and male prostitutes. In Pakistan, men who have sex with men comprise a highly vulnerable group which needs to be targeted for HIV/AIDS awareness-raising interventions."

        "abstract": "More than one million Indians are already infected with HIV and an epidemiologist at the AIDS Control and Prevention Project's regional office in Bangkok predicts that India will have the largest HIV-positive population in the world by 1995. Sexual networking in which people have sexual relations with two or more partners, either serially or concurrently, is the principal mode by which HIV is disseminated through large populations with a multiplier effect. Since physical symptoms of HIV infection typically are not manifest for many years after initial infection, however, infected individuals and their partners generally do not know that one or both are infected with HIV. Many people do not believe that HIV exists and that they may be at risk of infection. As such, it is very difficult to convince them to protect themselves against exposure. The picture of HIV and AIDS in 1994 is not one of infection exclusively among prostitutes, drug users, and homosexuals, but one of a shift from homosexual to heterosexual transmission in many areas and rapidly rising rates of infection among housewives and other women outside commercial sex activities. Studies in Thailand have documented the high incidence of sexual intercourse among Thai men with prostitutes, wives, and girlfriends. A World Health Organization study in Madras, India, found that while monogamy and sex within marriage are stressed in public, almost 4600 men visit prostitutes daily in the city. Generally visiting commercial sex establishments together and sharing one woman, friends drink heavily before having sex and tend to not use condoms. So many men have sex with prostitutes in Madras because of the segregation of the sexes in Tamil society, the late marriage age among men (26-30 years old), the large number and steady inflow to the city of single young men searching for work, the cultural perception of the mother as sacred, the male desire to lose one's virginity before an arranged marriage, and the anonymity of the urban setting. Complete condom coverage in Madras would require at least 9200 condoms per day. The author recommends instead abstinence and limiting sex to people known to be uninfected as the most effective strategy for avoiding HIV infection."

The public broadcasting services carry little information about the epidemic. A study indicating that 25/1700 prostitutes in Nairobi were positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been met with skepticism by the public, who question the survey (what was the relationship between researchers and prostitutes, were the prostitutes paid to risk their lives, why was the study carried out in Africa). Some believe the 25 positive women are 'immune' because of a similar gene pattern. There are 750,000 HIV positive adults and 30,000 AIDS cases in Kenya, including a large number of cases among street urchins. Most AIDS cases are sent home to die because of the short supply of hospital beds (45,000). One of these was Ruth Kasuki, a 36-year-old mother of three and AIDS educator and counselor in Kenya, who is now deceased. In an interview conducted shortly before her death, she criticizes the government for its denial and predicts disastrous results. Ms. Kasuki also blamed the extramarital affairs of men for the spread of AIDS among Kenyan women. 8% of women receiving antenatal care are estimated to have HIV; in Nyanza Coast and Nairobi the estimate reaches 12%.

Analysis of survey and interview data from Latin America indicates the existence of high fertility, unintended pregnancies, and sexually transmitted diseases among teens and young adults in the region. Most sexually active young adults for whom data are available report a low frequency of sexual activity, generally with one partner. Such a low frequency and sporadic nature of sexual activity may contribute to the inconsistent use of contraception. While the most commonly used method at first intercourse in many areas was rhythm, less than 31% of female respondents in those countries could identify the most fertile period during the menstrual cycle. Less than 26% of young males could identify the period of the menstrual cycle in which a woman is most likely to conceive. The combination of sexual experience at an early age and such lack of knowledge concerning reproductive health and contraception points to the need for effective sex education programs at the primary level in school and better surveillance data on youth risk behaviors."

Next, she cautioned against reducing prevention efforts simply because of a growing perception that treatment advances may obviate the need for prevention. Instead, prevention efforts should focus on the socioeconomic and cultural factors that marginalize individuals and foster high-risk behavior. A look at successful responses highlighted: 1) projects in India that empower sex workers, 2) successful programs created by the homosexual community in Australia, 3) efforts to reduce the danger posed to iv drug users, 4) community-based programs to reduce drug abuse, and 5) projects to reduce discrimination and increase care for affected individuals. Finally, she called for increased networking and creation of partnerships to maximize the effectiveness of prevention and care efforts, as well as emphasizing the importance of working with affected individuals; recognizing the relationship between empowerment, care, support, and prevention; developing political will to affect change; and respecting human rights."

New research includes not only an ongoing concern to describe the distinct contours of different social and cultural constructions of sexual identity (a concern that has been evident in this field for 3 decades), but also a concern to describe the complex process of social, cultural, economic and political change taking place in sexual cultures throughout the region. Numerous papers now document the dilemmas confronted--and the creative solutions that have been invented--by Latino American men in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and the emerging struggles for sexual rights and sexual-determination that can now be seen emerging in major urban centers throughout the region. These papers demonstrate the limitations of the dominant North American models of behavior change in response to AIDS by carefully uncovering the culturally articulated worlds of intimacy and desire that such models ignore, pointing the way toward a culturally constituted prevention practice as the only possible route to health promotion--possibly among all marginalized and vulnerable populations."

This paper posits that rapid urbanization, together with the sex behavior of single migrant workers, deported HIV-infected expatriates, the exploitation of women, and the easy availability of narcotic drugs, especially in Karachi, are some important factors which may be responsible for the spread of HIV in Pakistan. Pakistan's population profile, patterns of HIV transmission, and government initiatives are discussed.

The tourist industry is at particular risk from the pandemic because of the mobility of the work force, the presence of sex tourists, and the heavy reliance of many countries upon tourism revenues. Indeed, tourism is one of the largest and fastest growing industries in many countries. Some people have speculated that potential tourists' fear of AIDS could discourage them from visiting certain countries, while others have even suggested that tourism should be discouraged because the industry contributes to the spread of HIV/AIDS. When traveling, tourists often take risks that they would not take at home. They tend to drink more, use drugs more, and be generally more adventurous while on holiday. Such adventures often include taking sexual risks. When tourists have sex with prostitutes, hotel staff, and others in the local population, a bridge can be created for HIV to cross back and forth between the tourist's home country and the tourist destination. The author reviews selected studies on the relationship between HIV/AIDS and tourism. Overall, the existing literature offers no definitive evidence that AIDS has had any lasting impact upon the tourism industry anywhere in the world. Rather, promoting a healthy tourism industry and HIV/AIDS prevention are likely complementary in many ways."

Sex is for procreation and should be experienced only within the limits of marriage, and homosexuality does not fit within the Hindu emphasis upon marriage. However, the person with AIDS should be treated with selfless spirit and reminded of the immortality of the soul as explained in the Hindu Scripture. The Catholic Church does not recognize homosexual relationships and does not promote the use of contraception. A Christian would, however, encourage the person with AIDS to make use of his or her remaining days of life and to look forward to a better afterlife.

Common STDs include syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, herpes, AIDS, genital warts, chancroid, and trichomoniasis. Some STDs are caused by bacteria, while others are viral. Antibiotics can often effectively defeat bacterial infections, but few treatments are effective against viral infections. The viral STDs herpes and warts are painful and/or unsightly, while HIV infection is fatal. STD infection may be acquired through sexual contact with the penis, vagina, anus, mouth, and throat. Sexual abstinence, mutual monogamy with a non-infected sex partner, and sexual intercourse with the consistent, proper use of a latex condom are ways to avoid contracting and transmitting STDs through sexual intercourse. If one uses IV drugs, it is important to not share injecting equipment. If a partner refuses to use a male condom, a female condom may be used. Polyurethane condoms are also available on the US market for people who are allergic to latex. Male and female condoms are available over the counter in drug stores, supermarkets, and convenience stores. It remains unclear whether nonoxynol-9, the active ingredient in most US spermicides, prevents or facilitates HIV infection. STD infection is often asymptomatic in women.

A World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiologist, however, has completed the first comprehensive, nationwide survey of HIV prevalence rates in Malawi. 1.6 million of Malawi's 11 million population are infected with HIV, making it one of countries in Africa worst affected by the epidemic. In 1995 alone, there were an estimated 265,000 new HIV cases and 74,900 deaths from AIDS. There are also fears about the safety of the blood supply. The WHO survey suggests that three of the country's 62 hospitals are not testing blood for HIV. Moreover, the effectiveness of the system is undermined by the widespread carelessness and dishonesty of overworked technicians who conduct the tests. While the reasons are many and complex for the spread of HIV, it seems that the policies of former President Hastings Kamuzu Banda were a contributory factor. President Banda's neglect of grassroots health care, especially in rural areas, and his refusal to allow public debate on the disease no doubt fueled the spread of HIV in Malawi. Traditional sex practices also probably play a role. For example, in some ethnic groups, young teenage girls are sexually initiated by men specially chosen for their physical prowess. Any one of these men who happens to be HIV-seropositive and has sex with many of these young girls may pass the virus on to many other people."

Dr. Allan Ronald, who heads the department of medicine at the University of Manitoba, and 2 of his colleagues, Drs. G.W. Hammond and Frank Plummer, reported their findings to the Canadian Medical Association in August 1986. They reported the virus causing AIDS is transmitted in 3 ways. The main route is direct sexual contact, specifically genital to genital intercourse and receptive anal intercourse. A 2nd route is perinatal transmission, from infected mother to newborn. In such cases the transmission risk can be as high as 50%. In Africa, heterosexual intercourse is by far the most common route of infection, with prostitutes considered to be a high-risk group, but the virus has been slow to move into the heterosexual population in North America. Kenya was the 1st country in African to officially acknowledge the presence of AIDS, reporting cases to the World Health Organization (WHO), introducing a national policy aimed at preventing the spread of the disease, and creating an AIDS committee for control and investigation. The Kenya-Canada collaboration began with a study of genital ulcers in conjunction with the microbiology department of the University of Nairobi. It has since expanded to include all sexually transmitted diseases. According to Dr. Ronald, the best information from the international meeting held in Paris in June 1986 led to pessimism, that is, \"there is no evidence that, if people become infected but live for a number of years without symptoms, they won't eventually die of the disease.\" Thus, the focus must be on prevention of the spread of AIDS through the use of condoms or other measures. The doctors from Manitoba also identify a change in sexual habits as another solution."

        "title": "Modern contraception and venereal disease.",
        "abstract": "Data on the rising incidence of venereal disease and its relation to the use of modern contraceptives is reviewed. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated the existence of 100 million cases of gonorrhea annually in the world, and the disease is now the most common notifiable infection after measles. WHO reported a worldwide 90% increase in syphilis since 1960, and nonspecific urethritis (viral) has been reported as common as gonorrhea in England and Wales. Several studies indicate that sexual intercourse is initiated at a younger age and that premarital and extramarital sexual experience are increasing. Over 60% of women with gonorrhea have no symptoms; syphillis is milder in women than men, and nonspecific genital diseases are more difficult to detect in women. The mobile society promotes casual sex which favors the spread of venereal disease. Although reliable evidence is scanty, oral contraceptives fail to provide a physical barrier and could thus facilitate transmission. A recent study of 522 patients attending a venereal disease clinic in Uppsala, Sweden showed that the number of partners and frequency of intercourse had increases for 141 women on the pill. Genital infection was common, and gonorrhea was diagnosed in 67% of 250 women. Evidence further suggests that the pill's alteration of the glucose metabolism changes in the genital tract resembling pregnancy may favor the growth of vaginal candidal infestations. Evidence also indicates that IUDs may increase the incidence of pelvic infection, and the dangers of tubal blockage are likewise increased for the IUD user contracting gonorrhea. The condom remains the best protection against the spread of venereal disease particularly if it is worn prior to intercourse and throughout intercourse."

        "abstract": "This editorial explores the role of the church in addressing the issue on sexuality and AIDS in the Pacific. Cultural, traditional, and religious constraints hinder people from discussing their sexuality. The belief that \"talking about sex and sexuality will promote sexual activity or promiscuity\" poses an obstacle to open and honest discussion of the issue. Moreover, people who believe that the disease is a punishment from God sustained the shame and stigma attached to AIDS. Since the church has a strong influence on lives of Pacific Islanders, it can as well help in shaping sexual attitudes and behaviors of people by providing AIDS education. This can be achieved by encouraging parents to have an honest and open discussion on sex and sexuality with their children and organizing activities with young people. In addition, religious leaders can help remove the stigma attached to AIDS by encouraging congregations to discuss the issue on sex and sexuality more candidly and take care of HIV/AIDS patients. Throughout the Pacific, churches are starting to initiate movements against AIDS."

The multi-stage Education for Life program uses the helping skills model of Egan to help individuals examine their lives and especially their sexual behavior, determine which behavior is safe and possible for them, and then commit themselves to action. Group support helps clarify the problem and increase commitment. The program is designed for use with groups living in areas of high HIV prevalence who need to practice safer sex. Depending upon the age and experience of individuals in the group, the model aims to either reinforce existing safe behavior or bring about behavioral change. Either way, individuals in the group choose the appropriate behavior and commit themselves to it. Participants must be willing to meet and share. Group facilitators must be committed, prepared, knowledgeable about HIV infection, and believe that behavioral change is possible. Groups typically meet for one hour per week."

        "abstract": "Four of the papers presented at a panel on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) at the 1994 conference of the Australian Anthropological Society focused on Thailand, which is widely regarded as the epicenter of the epidemic in Southeast Asia. In his introduction to these papers, Lyttleton notes that the discourse on AIDS in Thailand has been characterized by a medical, hierarchical approach. Unlike the situation in countries such as the US, where homosexuals have engaged in collective activism to prevent the further spread of AIDS, Thailand's high-risk groups (e.g., prostitutes and injecting drug users) lack the group identification essential for the development of a culture of safe sex practices. Any discussion of AIDS in the Thai context must include an examination of the role of social drinking in framing men's public sexuality and male identity. Moreover, the homophobic nature of Thai culture has led to a dismissal of the reality of homosexual transmission."

They screened 28 pedophiles, but only 10 agreed to take part in the study and just 7 completed the study. The researchers used the following sequential measures: patient self-reports, nurses' observations, phallometry, hormone levels, and side effects. The small numbers prevented the researchers from conducting statistical analysis. Both drugs performed similarly. Their effects appeared to depend on dose (e.g., 200 mg had a greater effect than 100 mg). The drugs inhibited sexual thoughts, fantasies, and sexual frustration. They also reduced the frequency of early morning erections on awakening and the frequency and pleasure of masturbation. The drugs also reduced the percentage of erection, but the reductions were not as great as those of the aforementioned effects, and the responses were more variable. The drugs led to a decline in serum levels of testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone, but by the end of the third placebo phase, almost all serum levels either returned to or exceeded predrug levels. These findings indicate that CPA or MPA use may provide modest short-term improvement in the behavior of pedophiles, but this improvement is largely limited to psychologic responses. In addition, this study shows that few pedophiles voluntarily agreed to take an antiandrogen, suggesting the need for more research identifying more acceptable treatments."

The biggest problem exists in Yunnan province, which shares a border with Burma, a major drug producer.

These interactions are influenced by a diversity of factors, including gender inequalities, societal norms, power, socioeconomic status, knowledge, and personality. The poor, the marginalized, the young, and many women are at a disadvantage in protecting themselves from sexual exploitation and sexually transmitted diseases. Programs that seek to instill self-confidence and sexual negotiation skills in individuals overlook the pervasive influence of cultural norms. The focus of AIDS prevention programs must shift from the empowerment of individuals to community-wide considerations of sexual health. Finally, any program that seeks to encourage young people to redefine social norms governing their sexual relationships must also reach out to the adults (from parents to community leaders) who wield power over these young people."

        "abstract": "The female condom is a soft, pliable, prelubricated polyurethane pouch which is inserted into the vagina prior to having sexual intercourse. A flexible polyurethane ring encircles the condom's open end to prevent the entire pouch from entering the vagina during intercourse and to cover the vulva while allowing an entryway for the penis. A smaller flexible ring inside of the condom helps to position and hold the condom within the vagina. Studies have found the female condom to be as effective as male condoms or other female controlled barrier methods in preventing pregnancy. Moreover, the female condom is theoretically better than the male latex condom because of its lower leakage and slippage rates. A recent study in Thailand has shown that accessibility of the female condom can lead to a reduction in STIs among prostitutes, while Trussel et al. estimate that perfect use of the device may reduce the annual risk of acquiring HIV by more than 90% among women who have sexual intercourse twice weekly with an infected male. Women participants in several studies in Africa, however, have complained that the female condom is too long, and over-lubrication has been a reported problem in areas where dry sex is preferred. On the other hand, some users have found sexual intercourse using the female condom to convey the same level of physical sensitivity in the genital region as intercourse without using a barrier method. Evidence suggests that the female condom may be acceptable to men and women in certain types of sexual relationships, but unacceptable in others."

While adolescence is typically regarded as a period of life relatively free from health problems, adolescents are actually in need of the attention of health professionals and health services, especially with regard to sexual health. A trend of decreasing age at menarche and increasing age at marriage presents adolescents with a substantial number of years in which they will experiment with their developing reproductive organs and sexuality. Substantial psychological and physical change takes place during this period. Inconsistent and suboptimal users of contraception, youths are at high risk for reproductive health problems and sexually transmitted diseases. Substance abuse, unintentional and intentional injuries and their sequelae, academic underachievement and illiteracy, and obesity may also be problematic for adolescents. Adolescents are, however, most damaged by internalized and externalized homophobia. The authors point out that adolescents may be persuaded to learn and change their behaviors more readily than adults. Appropriate messages could be conveyed through targeted information, education, and communication strategies to complement medical and health care services which are available, accessible, and acceptable."

They have used the media for condom promotion and other sexually transmitted diseases. There have been 151 deaths caused by AIDS by the end of 1988; 344 cases are known, and 130 additional have tested positive to the virus. Health officials were reluctant to recognize the problem, thinking it was outside their country and that they would not be affected by it. Since then, they have tried to target high risk groups and educate them and assist with testing and counseling. There is a move to make the new drug zidovudine available, but few could afford its high price. The authorities have put transvestite prostitutes in jail and kept them for AIDS testing, but few woman prostitutes have been tested. Up until 1986, only 30% of the Red Cross blood bank supplies were being tested; now 80% are, although it comprises only about 40% of the total supply. Drugs are used heavily, but mostly smoked, in Colombia, yet there is some concern about increased use of needles. The majority of cases in Columbia have been homosexual and bisexual men, but prostitution among men and women is prevalent in large cities such as Bogota. Health officials state that education is the best deterrent, but must be perpetuated so people will be constantly reminded."

Two distinct conceptions of seropositive identities that emerged in the Brazilian HIV/AIDS movement were examined. These two differing conceptions have taken shape as the basis for social action and activism around AIDS-related issues such as prevention, treatment and care. The first of these conceptions suggest that all people whose lives have been touched by HIV and AIDS can work together, based on principles of solidarity, in seeking to respond to the epidemic--whether or not they were themselves directly infected with HIV. The second, more specific conception suggests that those infected by HIV share a number of common experiences that distinguish them from others, while at the same time recognizing the specificity of homosexual men as opposed to heterosexual women or injecting drug users. Despite the differences, the two conceptions promote various common purposes such as the social integration and participation of HIV-positive persons in confronting AIDS, fighting for better life conditions, defending civil rights and breaking clandestineness and isolation. The differences appear mainly in the ways of organizing and political and social representation."

Focus groups and semi-structured interviews were conducted with gay-identified men from both working class and middle-class backgrounds, non-gay-identified men who had sex with men, \"fletes\" (young men who sell homosexual sex), and transvestites. Ages among the study group ranged from 18 to 35. Issues explored included homosexuality and bisexuality, sexual experiences, socialization and support networks, \"fleteo\" and prostitution, AIDS-related concerns, emotional attachment, sexual identity and self-image. Findings suggest that a unitary homosexual culture does not exist in Lima. Ideologies structuring relationships within homoerotic culture range from more the more traditional, in which relationships are organized according to gender-transformed relationships, whereby ordinary males performed as \"activos\" with feminized \"pasivo\" males, to contemporary Western patterns involving equals who are able to exchange sexual roles. Awareness of this diversity should facilitate the identification of different sexual health needs and the protection of sexual rights, leading to the development of programs more sensitive to the cultural heterogeneity of male homosexualities in Lima."

The earliest form of infection is believed to occur within a few weeks of exposure to the virus, and some patients develop an acute syndrome that resembles infectious mononucleosis. These symptoms disappear after 4-6 weeks, by which time the patient has developed antibodies to the virus. About 2-4%/year of asymptomatic carriers go on to develop AIDS-related complex (ARC), and 15-30% of ARC patients develop AIDS within 5 years. The 2nd question posed is, \"How do you catch AIDS?\" To cause infection, the virus must go directly into the blood, although the virus alone may not be enough to cause sickness. Previous viral infections such as hepatitis B, herpes, cytomegalovirus, and intestinal parasites have been suggested as co-factors of AIDS. Promiscuity increases the chances of contracting AIDS. Observations of the families of AIDS patients and health care personnel who work with AIDS patients suggest that AIDS cannot be caught by casual contact. Finally, it is asked, \"What is being done about AIDS?\" 4 strategies are outlined: 1) as a result of donor screening for antibodies to HTLV-III/LAV, AIDS has been completely removed from the blood banks; 2) virologists are attempting to understand the virus so that it can be attacked, and understanding has been advanced by the theory that HTLV-III might be what is called a \"slow virus;\" 3) education about AIDS is changing the sexual practices that transmit AIDS; and 4) epidemiologists are carefully following those who are at risk, have been exposed, or are already sick."

Data on 2147 trips were collected, of which 2047 were return trips and 49 involved an overnight stay. A total of 1337 sexual contacts was made during the study period, giving each participant an average of 2.3 sex contacts per week. No significant difference was observed between urban and rural dwellers. Only 14 men, however, were responsible for 82% of the casual contacts. Each of these men had 11 or more partners in 16 weeks and would have 20-40 partners per year if their reported behavior is typical of them. These findings confirm that Uganda's business community is at particular risk of contracting and spreading HIV."

In the Caribbean, the ratio of HIV infections is now almost equal between men and women. In Latin America, infections among women are on the rise and in sub-Saharan Africa, where the transmission of HIV is overwhelmingly heterosexual, more women than men are infected. As more women become HIV-positive, the number of infections in their babies also rises. The simple fact of being married can raise the risk of infection among women, because infidelity is more commonly accepted among men than women. Women cannot always persuade their partners to use condoms, nor do they always have the option of refusing sex. To overcome the problem of noncooperative men, current research is focusing on female-controlled HIV prevention methods, such as female condoms or virus-killing spermicides. The US-based Population Council is also exploring the possibility of developing a virucide or microbicide which could be inserted into the vagina to protect against HIV transmission, while allowing sperm to pass unharmed. However, a product is not likely to appear on the market in the near future. Because there is no immediate prospect of an HIV vaccine or cure, HIV prevention should continue to focus on getting people to change their sexual behavior."

        "abstract": "Now in the third decade of the AIDS pandemic, much has been learned about the virology and epidemiology of HIV and AIDS, as well as the biological and behavioral factors which enhance its transmission, but neither vaccine nor cure has been developed. Contracting and transmitting HIV can, however, be prevented and is currently the most effective way to control the spread of AIDS. 75% of HIV infections worldwide are the result of sexual intercourse and relations without the use of a condom. Programs designed to reduce the sexual transmission of HIV will therefore have the greatest impact in curbing the progression of the pandemic. Biologically susceptible to infection and more likely to have untreated sexually transmitted diseases (STD) which increase their risk of acquiring HIV, women are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. As such, the care and prevention of STDs has become a major element of the overall approach to controlling HIV. In so far as behavior is concerned, much has also been learned from research about why people engage in behavior which puts them at risk of infection and what may be done to change such behavior. It is clear that knowledge of the basic facts of AIDS is insufficient to induce behavioral change. Prevention programs instead need to communicate the benefits of low-risk behavior and provide people with the skills they need to practice safer sex. Behavioral change must then be sustained. Success stories and future challenges are considered."

A structured questionnaire was administered to a random sample of 215 males aged 18-22 inquiring retrospectively about preventive behavior during their first intercourse. 22 in-depth interviews were also conducted. Findings indicated that the youths received most of their information about contraception and the prevention of STDs from the media, from instructional materials, and from their social lives. Their girlfriends provided them with information about contraception. They were also fully aware of the risks of unprotected sex vis-a-vis pregnancy and STD infection. Most males had the opinion that contraception and the prevention of STDs was the joint responsibility of both man and women. The typical age at first intercourse was 16-17 years. 1 in 4 males had had only 1 sexual affair; two-thirds had a steady relationship; and most had had a 1-month relationship before intercourse occurred. 46% used the condom and 33% used the pill, but only 7% used both. Nothing was used in 1 in 10 cases. When the woman did not use the pill, 1 in 4 males did not use a condom. Females seemed to take the initiative just as often as males did. Condoms were mainly used to prevent pregnancy. Discussion about STDs were avoided as someone else's problem. Only 18% of males used the condom in steady relationships, and most couples started using pills after a few sexual encounters. The condom was discontinued mostly because of inconvenience and unreliability. The initiation of pill use was in most cases the female's task or a joint decision. Young male adolescents should be instructed about the real risk of contracting STDs such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, the perceived risk of which among them, in addition to AIDS, is low."

Setbacks in abortion rights include introduction of a bill to outlaw the performance of \"intact\" dilatation and evacuation abortions, an extremely rare procedure used when a mother's life is in danger. In a general government appropriations bill, the health insurance programs for federal employees may not pay for abortion unless a woman's life is in danger. Those covered by the insurance may not purchase additional insurance with their own funds to provide for the cost of an abortion in cases of rape or incest. Other action removed President Clinton's order to fund medicare abortions in cases of rape or incest and overrode the actions of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education which attempted had to insure that obstetric and gynecology students would become trained in abortion techniques. Title X family planning funding was stripped and then restored, an \"Adolescent Family Life Demonstration Program\" was renamed the \"Abstinence Counseling Program,\" and funding for the Office of Surgeon General was cut. AIDS funding mechanisms were subject to efforts to discriminate against homosexuals, and organizations said to promote homosexuality were singled out to be denied federal funding. These attacks on the rights of small groups of Americans are part of a larger effort to deny the right of all Americans to make responsible decisions regarding their sexuality."

        "abstract": "The AIDS epidemic has brought to the fore many social injustices; for instance, inappropriate laws. The groups of people most at risk of HIV/AIDS are women, young people, and sex workers. More appropriate laws are needed to protect their rights. In many instances sex workers are prosecuted for selling their services, but their clients are not prosecuted for seeking these services. Most people become sex workers so they can feed, clothe, and supply the basic needs for themselves and their families. Many sex workers are abandoned wives, mothers with no means of support, and poverty stricken people. A Health Ministry commission in Sweden proposed that prostitutes, clients, and pimps be prosecuted and be liable to imprisonment. Authorities in Scotland, where prostitution is illegal, have granted licenses to more than 20 clubs in Edinburgh in which sex is for sale. In the UK, the Royal College of Nursing called for a measure to decriminalize prostitution and to introduce licensed, regulated brothels. The legalization of sex clubs and brothels will occur soon in the Netherlands. In Poland, 30,000-50,000 youth, 33% of whom are underage, sell sex during holidays. Organizations are beginning to work only with male prostitutes in Belgium. In the countries of the former Soviet Union and China, prostitution is becoming more and more common. Some young girls in these countries practice currency prostitution. In almost all Asian countries except Thailand condom use is low; yet prostitution and sexually transmitted diseases are very common. Some people participate in the corrupt trade in women from Nepal to supply the sex market in Bombay, India. Sex tourism is still common in cities of Eastern Europe and the former USSR and in areas where tourism is increasing. There are more than 1 million prostitutes aged under 16 in eight Asian countries, with 400,000 in India. Sweden and the UK have taken steps to prosecute natives who have sex with children abroad. Philippine authorities are increasing their efforts to target foreigners involved in the sex trade."

        "abstract": "While Asia was the last region to be exposed to the global spread of HIV and AIDS, the incidence of HIV infection there is increasing fastest. The Asian Development Bank predicts mortality from AIDS will cause some town and village populations to begin declining by the year 2000. With an estimated 1 million people infected in India, and 400,000 in Thailand, these 2 countries are particularly exposed to the risk of epidemic HIV spread. In 5 years, more people may be affected by AIDS in India than anywhere else in the world. Concern over a growing presence of HIV is also merited for the Philippines, Indonesia, China, and the drug trade's Golden Triangle. The Second International Conference on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific in November 1992 stressed that AIDS no longer affects only homosexual and IV drug using populations. 50% of new infections worldwide in the first half of 1992 were among women, 65% of Thailand's AIDS cases are among heterosexuals, and 3-5% of Thailand's long-haul truck drivers have tested positive for HIV infection. HIV and AIDS robs economies and societies of their best workers. The immediate costs of caring for AIDS patients will pale next to the far greater losses to be realized in private sector economic productivity. Asia's more developed economies will probably be able to survive the epidemic, but small, poor countries like Laos will wilt. Prompt action must be taken to overcome public and religious ignorance and objections to promoting and using condoms throughout the region. For the first time, Beijing has organized an AIDS awareness conference for male homosexuals. Further, Singapore has implemented compulsory testing for lower-income foreign workers. Pakistan has even solicited educational assistance and support from Islamic religious leaders; similar action is being considered in Bangladesh."

Supporting people who are HIV-positive and fighting for their rights is new in Malaysia. The group has thus far been publicized through its public education events, hospitals, and other nongovernmental organizations. For the first time, information is being published specifically by and for people living with HIV/AIDS. The project also has a phone line to allow people to speak anonymously with someone who shares their experience. Many callers are men who have sex with men in the social context of intense prejudice and discrimination. Afraid to openly acknowledge their sexuality with strangers, the callers have yet to accede to meeting each other face-to-face in a group setting. The author notes in closing that Pink Triangle must be realistic about what can be achieved in Malaysia and allow the group to develop according to people's needs and not on the basis of a model imported from outside of the country."

        "abstract": "Sri Lanka became known as a gay paradise with the advent of tourism in the late 1970s. UNICEF estimates that up to 15,000 boys in Sri Lanka may engage in homosexual prostitution. Nearly 400,000 tourists visited Sri Lanka in 1992, 50,000 of them British. The probable increase of high risk sexual contacts between tourists and Sri Lankan youths worries the government's health department. By early 1993, there were only 22 cases of AIDS and 65 people who tested HIV positive. But the government's chief venereologist says there are around 200,000 cases of sexually transmitted diseases each year, and it is estimated that as many as 2500 Sri Lankans are HIV positive. In a population of 17 million, this figure is small, but it represents an increase of 300% in just over a year. The parallels with nearby Thailand, where HIV spread explosively, are ominous. Unfortunately, cultural taboos make sex education difficult. A UNICEF doctor described the first television commercials about AIDS as ridiculous. Ignorance about AIDS is almost total. Most boy prostitutes have heard of AIDS but few use condoms and none realize that the disease kills. Organizations like Save the Children Fund recognize the magnitude of the problem but admit that reaching the beach boys, who are financially independent, is difficult. In an attempt to attack the problem, 2 social organizations compiled a list of beach boys in Hikkaduwa, the most popular tourist resort, and invited them for counselling and voluntary AIDS testing, but no one showed up."

        "abstract": "It is suggested that sex research is difficult and slighted because people are reluctant to discuss sex. In the context of AIDS research a workshop was conducted in June 1989 in Ottawa, Canada on Research on Sexual Behavior. The topics of discussion of a diverse group of professionals are presented in terms of factor influencing sexual research and future research needs. The purpose of the workshop was to explore the status of sexuality research and to identify cultural differences in sexual attitudes and practices pertaining to AIDS. The success of sexual research is based on sensitivity to and respect for the target population regardless of the type of research, and the personal attributes, and social taboos, norms, and pressures. Involvement of the community or related groups in the research process was also considered important. Qualitative as well quantitative methodologies are appropriate because, for example, determining the extent of condom use is important as well as knowing the reasons why people do not use condoms. The role of religion in the society and its impact on individual behavior is another important factor. Politics, as a 4th factor, can be an asset or detriment. How sex is negotiated and the subtleties of female sexual cues play a complex role in information exchange about safe sex. Conflicting opinions were expressed about the term safe sex and questions were raised about how to make condom use more attractive. Cultural norms can radically alter the approaches, for instance, to the use of condoms in cultures that believe that semen must be deposited in the vagina for sexual intercourse to take place. The use of specific vocabulary, such as prostitute, may present difficulties in cultures where a man or woman has sexual intimacies with friends who provide gifts of food, shelter, or clothing. The active male sexual partner may not see himself as a homosexual in a male liaison, and bisexuality poses similar problems of terminology. Future research needs include determinants of sexuality and female sexuality, risk reduction behaviors, and the acceptability of condom use. Cross-cultural similarities and differences were an important priority, as were exchanges of information."

Entire populations need to be taught which behaviors place them at risk for HIV infection and how to avoid them. However, for such educational programs to be effective, the sex practices which put people at risk for infection must be openly discussed in the print and broadcast media. Most Asian journalists do not write and broadcast honest, comprehensive reports on HIV/AIDS risk factors. Believing that they should not discuss such issues openly in their articles and broadcasts, most Asian journalists have done little to change existing cultural values and prejudices about sexuality and the situation of people living with HIV and AIDS. Instead of explaining which sex practices increase the risk of HIV transmission, news coverage in some countries gives the impression that HIV can be spread only through contaminated blood or that it is mainly a disease of IV drug users, foreigners, and those who adopt foreign lifestyles. The English-language media have covered HIV/AIDS better than the local-language media, but they have very little impact upon mainstream thinking and culture."

It is introduced with a review of the literature, which reveals an underlying research bias that prostitutes are a hazard to society and a lack of attention to how they negotiate various aspects of their daily lives. The next sections review the various degrees to which Indonesian women engage in sex work and the concept of multiple identities. The prostitutes support their moves from one identity to another (mother, lover, daughter, sister, sex worker) with various rituals and codes that govern degrees of emotional involvement. The description of the study methodology notes that sex workers from Jakarta (486), Bandung (342), and Surabaya (658) were studied using a variety of means and that this report draws mainly on qualitative findings. The report then discusses why the women begin sex work, the problems that arise when the women attempt to keep their disparate roles discreet, relationships with casual clients and rituals performed with casual clients to enhance cleanliness and prevent disease, relationships with regular clients, relationships with boyfriends, and relationships of older women with men who consider them their \"secret wives.\" The study concludes that the different roles and expected behaviors of these women must be understood to expose their sexual identities. Furthermore, programs to prevent disease must recognize that women who sell sex have complex identities and various types of relationships with men."

Despite the negative image the condom gained in the sexual revolution, when women were expected to take responsibility for contraception, condom sales are currently soaring. The San Francisco AIDS Foundation is about to produce its own condom under the brand name Play Safe and gay publications are endeavoring to eroticize the device. Used carefully, condoms can be highly effective; however, some studies have recorded a 4-10% pregnancy rate among couples who use them carelessly. Public health experts are now advising all sexually active individuals who have sexual relations with a new partner to use condoms. Preventive efforts have been hindered by bans on condom advertising and the prohibition of pictorial representations of the anogenital area in safe sex literature. The effectiveness of condoms in anal sex is unmeasured but can be increased by use of a water-based lubricant containing Nonoxynol-9."

Pregnant women found to have a sexually transmitted disease (STD) were educated about STDs, treated, and encouraged to refer their partners to the clinic for treatment. 418 of 1001 women enrolled in the program over the period April-September 1993 tested positive for infection with STD. More than 90% of these women agreed to inform their partners. The 384 women treated for a STD named 331 partners, of whom 101 went to the clinic for treatment after referral by the women, while 38 men sought treatment following health worker referral. The researchers emphasized the importance of communication and recommended treating partners at the same facility as the index patient and removing barriers to partner treatment such as clinic fees. More STD patients could be encouraged to refer their partners for treatment through community-based educational campaigns which stress the asymptomatic nature of most STDs and that many STDs are curable. Improving the communication skills of community health workers who refer partners may also increase referral rates.

The husbands of 225 women with cervical cancer and 791 controls in Bangkok and Chiang Mai were interviewed in a study to determine whether husbands' lack of condom use with prostitutes affects their wives' risk of developing cervical cancer. The cases studied were reported between 1979 and 1988 and were limited to women born after 1930 in Bangkok and after 1925 in Chiang Mai who had lived for at least 1 year in the areas served by the three hospitals which participated in the research. Among women whose husbands first had sex with a prostitute in their teens or 20s and who did not use condoms at that time, the risk of cervical cancer is twice that of women whose husbands had never visited a prostitute. All women reported having been married only once and having had sex only with their husbands. The period between date of marriage and diagnosis of cervical cancer ranged from 6 to 45 years, with a mean and median of 24 years."

The sample included 908 men (mean age, 27.9 years) and 331 women (mean age, 26.3 years), the majority of whom were unemployed or receiving social security benefits. Among male respondents, 50 were homosexual, 117 were bisexual, and 719 were heterosexual; for females these numbers were 10, 95, and 220, respectively. Oral and vaginal sex were the most commonly reported practices among heterosexuals, while homosexuals primarily reported manual stimulation and oro-genital contact. The regular sexual partners of male intravenous drug users tended not to be addicts, while female drug users were primarily involved with male partners who also abused drugs. Among male respondents, condom use was highest among homosexuals, followed by bisexuals, and lowest among heterosexuals; there were no significant differences by sexual orientation in female respondents' condom use. Overall, condoms were most likely to be utilized in anal sex and least likely in the case of oral sex. Condom use was about 5% lower when a regular as opposed to casual sexual partner was involved. Most of the 64 HIV-positive respondents were homosexuals, suggesting that sexual orientation rather than drug abuse was the primary risk factor. Given the finding that there is substantial variation in condom use among subgroups of intravenous drug abusers, it is recommended that HIV prevention programs adopt a diversified rather than uniform approach."

        "abstract": "Worldwide, it is increasingly recognized that sex occurs in prisons and this condition promotes HIV transmission among men. It is noted that in prisons, men usually engage in consensual or forced anal sex for lust, comfort, privileges or domination. This sexual behavior is one of the riskiest sexual practices in transmitting HIV infection because of the frequent tearing of sensitive anal membranes. In view of such a serious problem, that will also impact widely on the community when prisoners are released, a multi-pronged strategy is needed. Several initiatives addressing the issue are being reviewed or implemented in various countries. In Zimbabwe, among the listed options under consideration in the draft National Policy on HIV/AIDS, the most debated policy issue is the dissemination of condoms in prison. Much public dissent has been noted, in which the fear is that this would be seen as condoning homosexuality. However, it is emphasized that the issue in prisons is not one of homosexuality, but of recognizing that many heterosexual men in prison will take the only sexual outlet available to them (in addition to masturbation). In doing so, they are at great risk of HIV infection, hence encouraging mutual or self masturbation and actively promoting condom use must be part of the response to the epidemic issue."

An estimated 3 million people out of a population of 50 million are affected. 70% of the 700,000 prostitutes in Thailand are infected with a sexually transmitted disease. The phenomenal spread of these diseases is attributed to internal migration, the liberalization of sexual mores, the lack of resources for detection of sexually transmitted diseases in the provinces, and prostitutin. Many women who migrate to urban areas in search of employment are forced to turn to prostitution as a source of income. Prostitution became a growth industry in Thailand during the 1960s when 6 US military bases were installed along the borders of the country and rest-and-recreation programs arose. The soldiers have been replaced by European, Australian, and Japanese tourists, 60% of whom acknowledge that sex at a low price is their motive for visiting Thailand. There is widespread concern about the effects of undetected and untreated gonorrhea, including infection of the fallopian tubes, high risk pregnancies, female sterility, blindness in children, and systemic infection of future generations. The Ministry of Health has set up a gonorrhea control program aimed at improving the capacity of outlying small health centers to combat sexually transmitted diseases. Extensive research is underway to develop a simple, low cost method of detection that does not require the presence of a specialist. Another objective is to be able to analyze biologic cultures at small district hospitals. The goal is to make efficient methods of detection, diagnosis, and treatment available in all regions of the country within the next 2 years."

        "abstract": "From a medical and public health perspective, condoms are a valuable line of defense in the control of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Although some argue that the primary emphasis of HIV risk reduction campaigns should be the promotion of celibacy and monogamy, experience shows that it is necessary to provide safe alternatives for those who are unable to forego completely unsafe sexual behaviors or unhealthy activities. Many of the issues currently being raised in the debate about the role of condom promotion in the prevention of HIV infection were raised years ago in terms of condom use and the prevention of syphilis. Historically, syphilis, like acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), was associated with strong negative cultural values, including the idea that it was an appropriate punishment for sexual misconduct. The reluctance to endorse condoms has traditionally been related more closely to issues of morality, particularly the association of condoms with extramarital sexual intercourse, than to concerns about efficacy. If sexually active people are to be encouraged to use condoms, the image of this method must be upgraded. Historically generated negative images that link condom use with sexual incontinence, immorality, prostitution, disease, and risk taking must be replaced by images associating condoms with prudence, responsibility, and caring for one's partner. Although the different values that people hold about human sexual behavior will continue to clash, there can be agreement that condoms are a tool in the prevention of needless suffering and death."

The home language of 83% of the women and 85% of the men was Afrikaans, while the remaining subjects had English as a home language. One student was married, three were engaged to be married, and two lived together with a person of the opposite sex. 51 students were in steady relationships and 82 were single. 82% of the men and 90% of the women choose to have sex with someone of the same race. The study found a relatively low occurrence of sexual intercourse and promiscuity, and a very high percentage of subjects regarded themselves as heterosexual and as morally and religiously conservative. 97% of the men and 99% of the women regarded themselves as being heterosexual, and 3% of men and 1% of women regarded themselves as being bisexual. 6.6% of men and 1.34% of women, however, reported having had sexual contact with someone of the same sex. 37% of the men and 32% of the women reported having ever had sexual intercourse with a person of the opposite sex. These percentages are notably lower than those found by other investigators and the authors believe that a higher proportion of students at the university are actually sexually active than that suggested by this survey's findings. Among those sexually active, 17% of men and 18% of women were involved in sexual relationships with more than one partner. 68% of the sexually active men and women report using condoms often, 14% of men and 8% of women use contraceptives on an irregular basis, and 18% of men and 25% of women never use contraceptives. The birth control pill and condom were the most widely used methods. 85% of men and 86% of women felt that both partners should be responsible for taking precautions against unwanted pregnancy.

Few existing educational strategies, including those based on fear, consider adolescents to be responsible sexual persons or promote healthy sexual development, Yet, sex education programs must emphasize decreasing the risk of unprotected intercourse (delay of first intercourse and increasing the number of acts of protected intercourse). Family planning and sexuality specialists need a new definition of adolescent sexual health which can help them better deal with healthy adolescent sexual development. During the 1980s, public policies in the US revolved around sexual abstinence. Yet, normative adolescent sexual behavior was and continues to be sexual intercourse. The US Centers for Disease Control reports that 54.2% of students in grades 9 through 12 have had sexual intercourse during the last 3 months and, by 12th grade, 71.9% have had sexual intercourse. 16.1 years is the median age froM first intercourse for males and 16.9 years for females. Further, adolescents are practicing more preventive sexual behaviors. For example, adolescents were more likely to use a contraceptive at first intercourse in 1988, compared to 1979, 65% vs. 48%. Males were more likely to use a condom during their last intercourse (almost 60% vs. almost 30%). Nevertheless, many adolescents are still becoming pregnant and acquiring sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. Most adolescents have positive attitudes about sexual experiences. For example, 1 study shows that 87% of males and 64% of females did not feel pressured to have their first intercourse. Further, sexually experienced teenagers, except less than 15-year-old-females, tend to have higher self-esteem than the unexperienced. The Sex Information and Education Council of the US (SIECUS) promotes a comprehensive sexuality education program with a positive approach which helps adolescents develop a sexual identity. Such a program needs to affirm adolescents' sexual rights and advocate easy access to sexual health care services without parental consent. These programs must support virgins as well as adolescents who have sexual intercourse."

Unprotected penetrative anal sex also takes place, though it is generally not acknowledged by the prostitutes. These men and their clients are therefore in great need of information and access to condoms for the practice of safer sex. Both self- and social denial of the practice of anal sex must, however, be overcome. To this end, Bombay Dost, the 1st openly gay organization in India, distributes condoms and information to gay men on railway platforms, and in public toilets and parks. These efforts are unfortunately not welcomed by the prostitutes of Chowpatty beach for fear that acceptance of the intervention would imply their practice of anal sex and a more substantial degree of homosexuality within their subpopulation. Recruiting and training men as health educators from their ranks may be a viable, effective promotion approach. Any interventions must also understand the friendly and supportive, yet competitive, relationships within this community."

        "abstract": "In many African countries, the spread of HIV is aided by a complex knot of social, cultural, economic, and political factors. AIDS is becoming a disease of poverty, with the highest burden of prolonged economic crisis resting upon the shoulders of women. These same factors also result in women's enforced dependence on selling sex for survival and make sex workers highly vulnerable to HIV infection. However, concern for women in the context of the global pandemic has largely focused on their role in the transmission of the virus to others, primarily on their sexual partners and their children, rather than on their vulnerability. Blaming women for the spread of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) has resulted in considerable discrimination against them. Recognizing that sex work makes women more vulnerable to HIV leads to the conclusion that developing alternative sources of income for women is an important strategy for promoting women's health. In addition, women should be informed about traditions and conditions that may predispose them to STDs and HIV infection. Finally, rather than being stigmatized as the cause of HIV/AIDS, sex workers may be regarded as an indicator of the status of women."

        "abstract": "While recognizing the important role played by lesbian women in HIV/AIDS prevention in many countries, and as members of some gay organizations in the South, this article focuses only on gay men. Even though formidable societal proscriptions against homosexuality exist in many developing countries and Eastern European countries, gay men served duty on the front lines as AIDS educators and care givers. The threat of the AIDS crisis impelled some to openly acknowledge their sexuality in an effort to reach gay men at risk. In the West, gay organizations had already laid a 10 year foundation of organization and community trust, when the AIDS epidemic appeared in the public spot light. This fact allowed them to act as effective educators of their own gay communities. They were so effective that the number of new HIV cases has leveled off in the gay community. In Central and South America, gay movement cohered in 1976 and responded quickly to AIDS in 1983. In Africa, homosexuality is often considered a contamination of the West and national gay organizations (NGOs) have only recently been formed in Ghana, Tanzania, and Nigeria. The only AIDS services organizations (ASOs) for black men exist in Zimbabwe and South Africa. In Asia NGOs are a new phenomenon that exist only in Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. All NGOs have several things in common. Governments are rarely interested in working with NGOs so they are forced to find their own funding and develop their own education campaigns. Even in countries that recognize the implications and magnitude of the AIDS crisis, their education programs and policies are often homophobic or anti-gay. In the countries where the government is sympathetic to the gay community they rely upon NGOs to help them develop national education programs for both gays and the rest of the population."

        "abstract": "In the developing countries, the strategy of most HIV/AIDS preventive interventions involve sensitization of individuals to personal risk and social responsibility and encourage behavioral change, including the use of condoms. While condoms are potentially effective, a big difference exists between promoting them in commercial sex work and promoting them for general use. This paper argues that there may be unreasonable reliance on condom promotion in HIV/AIDS prevention programs in developing countries, and in many settings, sex will continue to be unprotected. Further, it may be more effective to put more emphasis on the promotion of genitally healthy sex. Occasional condom use may be worse than no use, in so far as the condom can increase the risk of abrasion to both parties and thus the risk of transmission in subsequent unprotected sex. A related matter is the lack of frankness in much of what is communicated about HIV transmission, as well as the inadequate understanding of sexual behavior among the populace. In view of such, donors and organizations should design scientifically effective interventions to promote genitally healthy sex."

These organisms are difficult to culture, but are striking in their motility. The bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis was seen microscopically in 94% of carriers of the motile rods, and cultured from 80%, but cultured from 29% of controls. The 2 groups had similar incidence of common STDs, similar incidence of bacterial vaginosis and of vaginal discharge. Contraceptive practice was similar in the 2 groups, except that IUDs were 3 times more common in carriers, although numbers were too few to be significant."

In this context, the World Health Organization's Global Program on AIDS' Office of Intervention Development and Support commissioned a comprehensive literature review to assess the effects of HIV/AIDS and sexuality education upon young people's sexual behavior. 52 reports culled from a search of 12 literature databases were reviewed. The main purpose of the review is to inform policy-makers, program planners, and educators about the impact of HIV and/or sexuality education upon the sexual behavior of youth as described in the published literature. Of 47 studies which evaluated interventions, 25 reported that HIV/AIDS and sexuality education neither increased nor decreased sexual activity and attendant rates of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). 17 reported that HIV and/or sexuality education delayed the onset of sexual activity, reduced the number of sex partners, or reduced unplanned pregnancy and STD rates Only 3 studies found increases in sexual behavior associated with sexuality education. Inadequacies in study design, analytic techniques, outcome indicators, and the reporting of statistics are discussed."

In nightclubs and drink shops in Laotian towns, social regulations established an atmosphere wherein casual sexual interactions were primarily built through negotiation. Unequal power relations between men and women notwithstanding, because neither identities nor outcomes are always fixed, a discursive space is created for men and women that provides potential opportunity for ideas of safe sex to be incorporated as an integral part of practice emerging from these settings. Paradoxically, however, the very avoidance of public scrutiny that affords this negotiation between the two parties, denies open legitimization of safer sex practice. Also exemplified in this paper are the surveillance, practice, and the staging identity in which the author briefly discusses the issue."

        "abstract": "The Australian study investigated condom-specific assertiveness and condom use as a means of prevention infection from sexually transmitted diseases. 211 men participated including 83 homosexual men (aged 19-62 years) and 128 heterosexual men (aged 17-49) who completed a questionnaire that comprised demographic details such as age, monogamy, and sexual activity as well as attitudinal and assertiveness measures. General assertiveness was measured by the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule (RAS) which had been widely used across a wide range of social situations. Assertiveness relating specifically to situations involving condoms was measured by the Condom Assertiveness Scale (CAS). Intention to use condoms was positively related to favorable attitudes, which were related to condom-specific assertiveness for both groups. For the heterosexual men only, general social assertiveness was negatively related to attitudes toward condoms. For both groups, the condom-specific measure of assertiveness was positively correlated with attitudes toward condoms. Condom-specific assertiveness was positively related to general social assertiveness as measured by the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule for the homosexual, but not for the heterosexual men. The negative relationship between general assertiveness and attitude to condoms among the heterosexual men implies that the risk reducing behavior of condom use did not seem to accord with the perceptions of masculinity and social assertiveness among heterosexual men. Thus, female partners of such heterosexual men exhibiting negative attitudes toward condom use combined with assertiveness would have to overcome resistance to insist on the use of condoms. Recently some advertising campaigns have been directed at women. The promotion of condom use among heterosexual men has to deal with the perceptions of condom use as unmasculine behavior."

This was in addition to examining behavior between sex workers and their clients, and among gay and bisexual men. The general population surveys found wide variations in the extent of premarital sex. For instance, while less than 10% of never-married men aged 15-19 in Burundi reported intercourse in the past year, the figure in Guinea Bissau was more than 50%. For young women, the proportions were 3% and 30% respectively. In Singapore, 3% of never-married men aged 15-19 reported sex in the past year, compared with 29% in Thailand. The proportion of men aged 15-49 reporting sex outside regular partnerships in the past year also varied widely (Burundi 8%, Central African Republic 14%, Cote d'Ivoire 50%, Lesotho 42%, Philippines [Manila] 15%, Sri Lanka 3%, and Thailand 30%). Divergent levels of condom use during commercial sex reflected differences in availability and cultural norms. Early in 1991, GPA's Steering Committee on Social and Behavioral Research identified research on the social and contextual factors affecting risk-related sexual activity as a high priority. A prototype research protocol was developed and used to brief selected potential principal investigators from countries in Africa, Central and Southern America, and South and South-East Asia, who were interested in preparing proposals for studies funded by GPA. As a large proportion of infections occur among young people, GPA's research support will focus primarily on the contextual factors affecting risk-related sexual activity among teenagers and young adults. It will examine how young people learn about sexual issues and sexual meanings, the contexts in which sexual activity takes place, and how sex is explained and understood."

According to the WHO, more than 18.5 million HIV infections have occurred in the last decade, almost half of which in people aged 15-24 years. The data indicate that the youth are engaging in unprotected sexual intercourse exposing them to the high-risk of HIV/AIDS infection. In the absence of a cure or vaccine, preventive measures are the main weapon in the struggle to contain the epidemic. In this regard, behavioral change towards risk reduction is the only viable preventive measure. Awareness campaigns and counseling services should be made available to all the young people in the communities. Appropriate use of media and print materials, sex education in schools, and involving youths in studies on adolescent sexual behavior are important avenues to be considered. In conclusion, there is still hope for youths, which can only be realized if young people are made aware of the benefits they stand to gain from avoiding HIV infection. Parents, church leaders, political leaders, and teachers play important roles in this endeavor."

Since it has been shown that people with high self-esteem are more likely than others to have safer sex, all of the postcards encourage readers to be proud of their sexuality an to take care to not become infected with HIV. The cards and messages were developed through the project \"Talking Safer Sex - Man to Man\" established by the creator of the central postcard character, the committee's safer sex outreach worker, and a group of men from varied backgrounds. These founders wanted to present a realistic view of sexuality and to portray bisexual and homosexual men as being comfortable with having safer sex. They also did not want to put forth the image of every male on the cards as being stereotypically beautiful and muscular. The star of each card is a cartoon character called Captain Condom. Using this figure, each card depicts a specific group or situation such as young gays or the dangers of drug use. One card reminds bisexuals of the importance of protecting their female partners, while another reviews the dangers of forgetting to use condoms when sexual passion takes control."

        "abstract": "AIDS education campaigns, which tend to be practical and direct, assume people have viable choices in sexual relationships, but they do not. Cultural, social, political, and economic factors restrict their control, including protecting themselves against AIDS. People in developing countries often must leave their families for long periods of time for employment, which makes them lonely; so they seek sexual affairs. In Thailand, poverty and underdevelopment force rural families to send young women to the cities to earn money for the families, but the cities already have many unemployed and unskilled people, so the women resort to prostitution. Girls often have sex with married men who provide them essentials. HIV appears to be more prevalent among women of low status. 82% of female AIDS cases in the world are found in Africa, where women have little control over their lives. They cannot even mention safe sex to regular partners without being rejected or battered. This is especially a problem for wives of migrant workers or truckers. The AIDS pandemic has illustrated how family planning programs have left out men in contraceptive decision making. Thus, family planning and AIDS education programs must reverse this trend to convince men to use condoms. In developing countries, just 3% of couples of childbearing age use condoms. Condoms are often linked with prostitution, casual affairs, and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. In South Africa, many Blacks think Whites promote condom use to control black population growth. In one AIDS project in South Africa, older women teach young girls about sex to eliminate harmful taboos. AIDS has forced public health and education professionals to come up with an approach to sex education which examines relationships and acknowledges the imbalances of power between men and women, e.g., assertiveness training courses in Swaziland."

Since there are cases of well informed groups that still do not alter their sexual behavior (i.e. teenagers in the UK and San Francisco), fact forcing campaigns cannot be the method of AIDS education. Facts along with behavioral motivation are needed. AIDS awareness campaigns must recognize denial factors that must be overcome before the campaign is even taken seriously. On the other end of the spectrum, exaggerated fears leading to irrational behavior and stigmatization must be prevented by supplying counselling programs to dispel these fears. A campaign must build trust and not underestimate its target population so that their self respect remains high enough to motivate them towards assertive action. Cultural problems, such as women who cannot discuss sexual options for fear of being socially stigmatized, need to have programs that instruct as well as develop a environment that supports change. School women's groups, work places, clinics, community networks, and religious organizations know a local temperament and beliefs, and therefore should be consulted on designing messages that best fit their peers language, literacy, and economic circumstances. Their is no single answer for an AIDS awareness campaign, but a mixture of facts, explanation, persuasion, and reassurance for each targeted community must be well planned. Since each campaign is an experiment, it should be carefully regulated."

Employing focus group discussions, informal interviews and home visits during 1999, the author discovered that a Sexually Transmitted Disease/HIV Intervention Project has been set up to promote disease control and condom distribution among these sex workers. Operating on three principles for its work--respect, recognition, and reliance, the program aims to create an impact on the sex workers themselves and their peers. Likewise, the need to build alliances with clients, training the police and forming the Durbar Mahila Samanvaya Committee were deemed as necessary. Several lessons were learned during the course of the research: use of stories and history to rally the community; retaining flexibility, meeting changing needs; using drama to promote communication; and negotiating with men and opposing patriarchy."

The purpose of this review was to find out if the human sexuality information was thorough, accurate, and up to date and if it was presented in a positive or prohibitive and judgmental way. It was found that 30% of the states were using a curricula on sex education published before 1985 and 47% were using more recent curricula. Most of the sex education curricula did not focus specifically on human sexuality, and many were out of date on guidelines, especially those on AIDS. There was an about an equal ratio of adequate to inadequate curricula used for family planning; to be adequate, the curricula must describe each birth control method, its risks, effectiveness, and availability. More than 50% of the states are implementing AIDS curricula that are over 3 years old. Most of the programs emphasize abstention (85%) but only 9% teach safe sex. Although most states are mandating sex and AIDS education, they are not following up with a comprehensive curricula, and are avoiding sexual topics, possibly to avoid controversy.

In developing nations, the situation is grim. The annual incidence of AIDS infection in central Africa is between 1 in 1000 and 1 in 2000 people. AIDS is found throughout the world, and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that at least 50-100 million people will be infected with the HIV virus by 1991. The cost of health care for victims of AIDS is splitting the world of health into the privileged and the underprivileged, even more cruelly than other development measures. According to Dr. Jonathan Mann, director of WHO's Special Program on AIDS, in the US the cost of caring for 10 AIDS patients is about $450,000 and is greater than the entire budget of a large hospital in Zaire. An estimated 8 of 10 cases of AIDs are the result of sexual contact. Sexual activity has been demonstrated to transmit infection between homosexual men, from man to woman, and woman to man. Pregnant women who have AIDS pass the disease to their babies. No one knows the absolute risk of infection with AIDS for a single sexual act. Thus far, about 1 in 10 wives of seropositive hemophiliacs has become infected. Thus, the risk of transmission at 1 intercourse may well be lower than that of bacterial disease. Research on AIDS moves rapidly at this time, but neither a vaccine nor an effective cure will be developed i n the short term. It is biologically plausible that a vaccine may never be developed due to the peculiar nature of the virus. With no known cure, the threat of AIDS has led to changes in the sexual behavior of some high-risk groups. If people are prepared to take precautions, an intact condom should be an effective barrier against the passage of the virus. Spermicides also may reduce the risk of sexual transmission of HIV."

Each April on the night of the full moon, however, the Chittirai-Pournami festival is held in Koovagam, a celebration in homage to Aravan during which up to 2000 pilgrims from across the country engage in thousands of acts of unprotected sexual intercourse. Aravan is a man depicted in a Hindu tale who asked to experience sexual bliss before being sacrificed to the gods. To fulfill this last wish, the god Krishna is said to have assumed the form of a beautiful woman and had sexual intercourse with Aravan. Many of the festival participants are hijras, eunuchs and transsexuals who sell sex for a living. Hijras may be accompanied by men who serve as their sex partners and bodyguards. Surveys suggest that one-third of the 10,000 hijras in New Delhi may be infected with HIV. Other participants are known as dangas, men who are either married or single and appear to lead strictly heterosexual lives throughout the year except during the Chittirai-Pournami festival when they dress as women and sell sex to other men attending the festival. The panthis comprise another group of participants and tend to be either single or married men who attend the festival to have sex with the hijras and dangas for fees up to ten rupees, approximately US$0.50, per sexual encounter. Prostitution within the devadasi sect and the sale of young, virgin girls in the state of Andhra Pradesh to the highest male bidders are other examples of how ancient traditions are facilitating the current spread of HIV in India."

The 4 major modes of transmission of AIDS in Africa are sexual contact, perinatal transmission, transfusion of infected blood or blood products, and the reuse of equipment such as needles and syringes. In 1985, a 2nd AIDS virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-2, was discovered in West Africa--a finding with important implications for epidemiologic surveillance, screening programs, and clinical diagnostic testing. Although 45 of the 50 African countries have developed concrete public health policies and strategies for the prevention and control of AIDS, most nations of sub-Saharan Africa lack the economic and social resources to implement these programs effectively. Thus, international cooperation and a commitment on the part of the US and Western Europe to provide assistance will be essential. Needs must be addressed on 2 fronts: treatment of those already infected or suffering from the disease and containment of the AIDS epidemic. Public health efforts should focus initially on high risk behaviors through health education. At the same time, it should be recognized that AIDS is not the largest health issue facing Africans, and there is a complex interaction between AIDS and other health problems such as malnutrition, genital ulcers, diarrhea, and tuberculosis. An approach to AIDS requires an expansion of public health initiatives in areas such as clean water supplies, maternal-child health programs, nutrition and immunization programs, and sexually transmitted disease clinics."

First, students discussed letters to an aunt explaining a teen's sexually-related problem. Premarital sex and the fear of STDs were at issue. Second, students filled in missing information on a line drawing relating to pregnancy. Most participants knew that a baby depends upon its mother for development and growth, but some were unclear on the nature of the biological connection to the uterus. Third, students completed a questionnaire upon which they indicated their agreement or lack thereof with statements on aspects of sex behavior. While both sexes indicated that love is more important than sex, they also find it necessary to have sex before marriage in order to gain experience and to know the other person better. Finally, students completed an anonymous questionnaire which produced the following results: 24% had experienced sexual intercourse; the most common age for initiating sexual activity was 15 and 13 years for boys and girls, respectively; 48% had heard about contraceptives; and 27% believed that contraceptives were dangerous and could permanently end one's fertility. Despite these students' limited amount of accurate knowledge about sexual matters, they are ready to confront real-life sexual situations. 130 parents, 110 teachers, and 26 health workers involved in clinics for family planning and STDs were also interviewed in the study. Contrary to the view of adults that adolescents should not discuss sexual matters, the youths initiated important discussions about their sexuality. 90% were interested in knowing about safer sex and STDs. Most parents believe that their children become sexually active later in life than they really do, with both parents and teachers supporting the withholding of information on birth control from adolescents out of fear that such knowledge will encourage them to experiment with sex. Young people instead need free and open access to family planning information and services to help them avoid unwanted pregnancy and infections with STDs. Moreover, the government campaign against HIV must start emphasizing condom use."

Numerous studies have identified a significant incidence of childhood sexual abuse in teenage mothers who neglect or abuse their own children. The experience of child abuse has been associated with psychiatric sequelae such as somatization, anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, obsessive-compulsive behavior, dissociation, and suicidality. Another study found that dissociation and depression were significant mediators between a child abuse history and negative life outcomes such as victimization and interpersonal difficulties. Also recorded has been a tendency for abuse survivors to use rapidly initiated sexual activity with multiple partners as a means of coping with feelings of depression, abandonment, and emptiness. A positive correlation has been noted between the severity of childhood abuse and the intensity of subsequent psychopathology. Also found has been considerable overlap between the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory scores of pregnant/parenting teens and abuse victims. If further research continues to substantiate the association between these two social problems, treatment of childhood trauma in high-risk teens may emerge as an important pregnancy prevention strategy."

        "abstract": "Women who engage in unsafe sexual intercourse may be at risk of unwanted pregnancy and/or infection with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). In a study of male industrial workers and students in the Republic of Korea, 21% of the sexually experienced workers and 11% of the sexually experienced students reported having caused pregnancy in a female sex partner. Most of the pregnancies were aborted, but 13% of the workers and 11% of the students became fathers. 22% of the sexually experienced workers and 8% of the sexually experienced students reported having had a STD, and some reported having sexual intercourse while infected. In a survey of students in Ilorin, Nigeria, 13% of the males reported having caused pregnancy, of which 70% were aborted. 9% of the females surveyed reported being pregnant at least once, with 77% ending in abortion. 10% of the young women reported experiencing abnormal vaginal discharge during the year before the study. A study of young men and women in rural Thailand found that only slightly more than half of the male respondents with STDs sought medical care from a physician; others either bought medicines from pharmacies or received no treatment at all."

In South Africa, the Law Commission is circulating a discussion paper on the ¿need for a statutory offense aimed at harmful HIV-related behavior¿. This paper provides an avenue to discuss the concerns over the government¿s plan to criminalize unprotected sex. In the paper, the author viewed that the most important effect of such a statute would not be in the number of actual murderers removed from the streets of Africa, but in the more subtle general impact such a statute would have. The statute might deter those thinking of passing on the virus thus adding to the hysteria around the disease. The author further mentioned other concerns related to the government¿s plan."

        "abstract": "Dr. Gilles Poumerol, Regional Adviser in Sexually Transmitted Diseases and AIDS, Manila, spoke on HIV/AIDS epidemiology in Asia/Pacific. He emphasized that by the beginning of the 1990s a number of countries in Asia, led by Thailand, observed an increasing number of infections; by 1998, the epidemic has been well established across the continent. While the rate of reporting for HIV and AIDS is estimated to be lower than 20% in many countries in Asia due to limited capacity for diagnosis, weakness of the reporting system, and confidentiality issues, estimates are based on the analysis of sentinel surveillance for HIV infection. Behavior surveillance in selected countries has been extremely instructive in understanding some determinants of the epidemic. On average, HIV prevalence rates appear to be closely related to the use of sex workers by young people. However, in the Philippines and Indonesia, sex workers and clients are playing a major role in the diffusion of the HIV infection in Asia. Hence, all efforts should be directed to such groups to prevent larger spread to the general population."

        "abstract": "Since 1981, the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has spread rapidly to many countries, but there is little information regarding occurrence of the disease in Africa. This is due partly to governmental refusal to acknowledge the AIDS problem, and also to inability to diagnose the disease and recent introduction of AIDS to many areas. The major mode of sexual transmission is heterosexual, with both males and females at risk. Perinatal transmission has not been adquately investigated. Intravenous injection and blood transfusion are other means of infection. AIDS has mainly been reported from Central African countries, with 4000 cases reported in Zaire (an incidence rate of 1:500). In Kenya, seropositivity rates range from 31-66% in prostitutes, 8% in males with STDs to 2% in a control group. The male: female ratio in Kenya is 2.7:1. Since the main route of transmission is heterosexual, the highest risk groups are those who are promiscuous, such as prostitutes and their clients. Other possible routes of transmission that should be studied include scarification rituals, tattooing, male and female circumcision and inadequate sterilization of needles re-used for medical treatment. AIDS is likely to cause an increased burden on the health budget due to the increasing incidence of opportunistic infections and cancers. Increases in cryptococcal meningitis and disseminated candidiasis have already been noted. Live attenuated vaccines may pose a risk to immunosuppressed children. Further research is needed to accurately determine all risk factors for AIDS transmission in Africa, to determine the actual extent of AIDS, to work out control strategies, and to determine the impact on other health facilities."

        "abstract": "Participants at a 2-day workshop on AIDS in Zambia concluded that women must openly discuss high-risk sexual behavior with their partners, if they are to protect themselves and their children. Entitled \"Basic facts about AIDS,\" the workshop identified marital infidelity as the greatest source of risk. Last year, a study revealed that, on average, men and women in Zambia had 2-3 sexual partners outside marriage. Demographic and cultural factors also contribute to the spread of AIDS. Zambia's sexually active population is large, since people marry at a very young age. The traditional practice of \"dry sex\" -- intercourse that involves male penetration of a tight, dry vagina -- causes internal abrasions, thereby facilitating the transmission of HIV. Even traditional sex education undermines efforts to control the spread of AIDS, since \"bamachimbusas\" (traditional sex educators) counsel girls to be subservient to their husbands and \"never say no.\" Boys receive no sex education at all. Meanwhile, Zambia faces an alarming HIV and AIDS trend, according to statistics collected by the Society for Women and AIDS (SWAAZ): in 1991, 12.5% of blood donors in Lusaka and 7.5% of donors nationwide were infected with HIV; infection among pregnant urban women ranged from 25-29%; 21% of malnourished children and 32% of children with tuberculosis are infected. Furthermore, it is estimated that by 1990, the AIDS epidemic had already orphaned 80,000 children. By the year 2000, it is believed that 1/2 million children will have lost at least one parent to the disease."

Young people have the highest rate of HIV infection; the highest prevalence among pregnant women is consistently found among 20-24 year olds. Female school dropouts and girls who have never been to school are at particular risk. Surveys indicate that many such women lack knowledge about HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases (STD), fail to practice safer sex, and do not have adequate access to health care. Many exchange sex for cash and other substantive offerings. Current education and prevention messages, however, are not enough to induce people to practice safe sex. Women may want to protect themselves against HIV infection, but be in no position to do so. For example, it is socially acceptable for the husbands of married women to have other sex partners. Should the man contract HIV from his extramarital partners, his wife will be at considerable risk; wives in Ghanaian society typically do not have enough power to demand safe sex with their husbands. Many other women must prostitute themselves to survive in the country's widespread poverty. The underlying social and economic factors which put women at risk for contracting and transmitting HIV must be addressed."

Although individual sex workers may be fined by the authorities and chastised in the press, there is no shortage of prostitutes who work night shifts, day shifts, and part time. Transvestites also work as commercial sex workers. Rates vary according to clientele with local men paying $5-10 for intercourse and tourists paying $20. Rates also vary according to type of sexual activity. No organized solidarity group or union exist for sex workers and most work individually guided by their needs and convenience often with regular clients. A few support groups are, however, developing. Workers have a tough time negotiating condom use. Many think taking a penicillin tablet daily will prevent STD, very few use the free government STD clinics, and very few have regular medical check-ups.

The Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS estimated that one-quarter of the global population will be infected with HIV by the close of 1998 and the rapid increase will be in the Mekong subregion, affecting as much as half of the labor force. Local officials in Thailand project that HIV population would rise from 850,000 to 1.2 million by the following year. Homophobia, sexism, and other inequalities work together to further the spread of the epidemic in the area. Main causes of the spread of infection include drug injection and needle sharing, unsafe sex practices, women and children trafficking, and lack of knowledge on safe sex. In light of this, activists argue that AIDS prevention campaigns must otherwise address belief systems of the people, thereby creating a new social sphere where preventive tools such as condoms can be used. Education on safe sex has to continue employing innovative ways to communicate to difficult-to-reach population groups. Launching of an inter-agency program that addresses trafficking and avoids overlap between agencies in the Mekong area is also needed."

        "abstract": "The evidence for impaired fertility of U.S. women after their mid-30s is reviewed in the context of historical studies on age-related fertility, and the factors determining subfecundity, particularly coital inability, conceptive failure and pregnancy loss. For comparison, early American women produced 7 children, falling to a low of 1.74 children in 1976. The factors affecting fertility are known as the Davis-Blake intermediate variables. Those in the 2nd category, mate exposure, affect middle-aged women because most childbearing is done by married women, and educated women over 30-34 begin to have difficulty finding husbands. Fecundity ranges from 0-30 children, and averages 15 in optimal conditions. Fecundity falls with age, but subfecundity may occur in addition due to factors such as pelvic inflammatory disease or complications of childbirth. The 1982 National Survey of Family Growth, and other studies find fecundity falling moderately with time but significantly after age 35. Historical studies show that fecundity falls as marital duration lengthens, owing to subfecundity and also to decreased coital frequency. Recent work suggests a high rate of sexual dysfunction, often underreported, ranging from 4% permanent impotence in men 40 to 40% of men and 63% of women. Conceptive failure is estimated at 8.5% of married women aged 15-44, rising sharply after age 35. Pregnancy loss is thought to be the most common cause of subfecundity due to aging. Sensitive tests show that 75% of all fertilized ova and 31% of all implanted embryos are lost, but only 25% of women are aware of pregnancy loss. The bottom line is that U.S. women who postpone childbearing until their 30s will have fewer children than they originally desired, due to a wide variety of factors."

        "abstract": "A sexually transmitted disease (STD) can endanger a pregnant women's fetus. Infected persons who continue to be sexually active need to understand ways to prevent transmission to others and may require effective contraception to avert an unwanted pregnancy. Counseling can help STD patients to comply with treatment, understand their contraceptive choices, and protect their sexual partners. When used correctly and consistently, latex condoms offer the best protection against the transmission of STDs, including HIV, but they are not highly effective in preventing pregnancy. Conversely, while oral contraceptives, IUDs, injectables, implants, and sterilization are effective in preventing pregnancy, they do not protect against STD transmission. In fact, there is concern that hormonal methods may increase the risk of HIV transmission and HIV infectivity. Similarly, the IUD may increase the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease in women with STDs. This article presents a brief review of the available research evidence on STD prevention and use of male and female condoms, spermicides, hormonal methods, IUDs, and the lactational amenorrhea method."

Family planning organizations can play an essential role in the prevention of AIDS. Their knowledge and experience in communicating the facts and outcomes of sexual activity need to be shared with agencies that are planning AIDS prevention campaigns. In recognition of this fact, Family Health International has established an AIDS task force encompassing epidemiologists, demographers, physicians, and public health researchers. Specific tasks will be to determine in vivo the effectiveness of condoms and spermicides in slowing the transmission of AIDS and assessment of the impact of education and service delivery programs on the use of these methods, especially among high-risk populations."

Sexual transmission is the main mode of transmission. Yet people in Asia do not want to deal with sexual behavior. Thus high level political commitment is needed such has been done in Thailand which has set up a national AIDS committee. An AIDS expert predicts that by 1995 the number of HIV positive individuals in Asia will surpass the number of HIV positive individuals in all the developed countries. India, Myanmar, and Thailand where prostitution and intravenous (IV) drug use abounds (the Golden Triangle) suffer from the worst AIDS epidemics in the region. International sex tourism contributes greatly to both the heterosexual and homosexual spread of AIDS. In fact, the national AIDS committee in Thailand has begun a campaign to stop sex tourism, but as of September 1991, it had no effect. Further some sex businesses have attempted to stop the spread of AIDS. For example, 2 brothels in central Thailand have implemented a condom only policy for their clients. High rates of sexually transmitted diseases among prostitutes facilitate HIV transmission. This highlights the need for Asian countries to promote condom use. Not all of the Asian countries screen 100% of their blood and blood products. In fact, in India, commercial blood banks do not always screen donated blood since screening eats into their profits. Further unsterile needles are often used in medical facilities such as in India and Viet Nam. Hong Kong sells inexpensive sterile needles over the counter which may account for its low HIV positive rate among drug users. Despite the many problems in Asia which facilitate HIV transmission, tragedy can be averted if governments act at once."

Family planning programs often target their services to young married women in the midst of their childbearing years who want to space births. A woman's reproductive life, however, lasts almost four decades. Family planning programs therefore need to consider adolescents, unmarried women, and women over age 40 since they may also be at high risk for unwanted pregnancy.

This article focuses on the linkage between the mortality and fertility transitions in Sri Lanka; it discusses the measurement of areal fertility, demonstrates the use of a measure not commonly used in population geography, and shows areal association between past mortality and recent fertility. The Coale or Princeton fertility indices allow a reasonably good view of structural and behavioral aspects of fertility; the Coale indices examine the contribution of structure to total fertility and the contribution of marital fertility. Although recent fertility decline has been less rapid than the post-war mortality decline, Sri Lanka's crude birth rate in 1975 was the 5th lowest in Asia. Sri Lanka experienced very high crude death rates in 1930, and quite low rates in 1950 and in subsequent years. This demonstrates an association between historic mortality and recent fertility, and that association can be linked deductively to demographic transition theory. In 1930, malaria was endemic throughout the Dry Zone of Sri Lanka, and hyperendemic in several districts. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients reveal the strongest relationship between malaria and nuptiality; this lends evidence to the notion that structural influences on fertility--such as delayed marriage--are more important than influences on marital fertility--such as coital frequency. The evidence suggests that mortalily decline in Sri Lanka led to an increase in fertility in those areas where malaria had been concentrated. This suggests the possibility that measures constituting malaria control or eradication also stimulate increased fertility; therefore, anti-malarial programs must be integrated with family planning."

Infertility, a consequence of STD, is seen as one of the most devastating things that could happen to an African woman. Behavioral risk factors for STD include age at 1st intercourse, number of sexual partners and use of contraception. The 1st two indicate length of exposure and amount of exposure respectively. Along with the prevalence of STD in the community, these factors allow an estimate of the population at risk for STD. Demographic risk factors from developed countries may not be applicable to developing countries. Data on sexual behavior in Africa is poor. Great intercultural variation exists. Age at 1st intercourse is earlier in Africa than America, with over 1/3 of African women reporting sexual activity by age 14, and 90% by age 17. Premarital sexual activity is high. Prostitution is widespread in African cities, and has been related to lack of expectations for marital fidelity, premarital celibacy and the infrequency of romantic love. Prostitutes play an important role in STD transmission. Current population growth in Africa has skewed the population towards the young, there has been rural to urban migration, and there are skewed sex ratios with many more men in cities: all of these factors predispose to STD. The high prevalence of untreated STD, resulting in increased infertility acts paradoxically to increase rather than decrease the fertility in Africa. Infertility is devastating for an African woman, resulting in divorce and diminished social status that often leads to prostitution. The fear of infertilty results in refusal of contraception and early childbearing to demonstrate fertiltiy."

HIV-1 subtype B is prevalent in the US and Western Europe and is transmitted mainly through anal sex between gay men or IV drug use. Only 10% of HIV-1 subtype B transmission is through heterosexual vaginal intercourse. Indeed, few non-subtype-B cases of HIV have been identified in the US, mainly because most HIV testing does not screen for subtypes. HIV subtype E, the Thai subtype, was first detected in the US in the Fall of 1995 by scientists at the US Naval Health Research Center in San Diego, California. The subtype-E infections in five American servicemen were discussed in the November 5, 1995 issue of the Lancet; three of the men contracted the virus from Thai prostitutes. HIV-1 subtype E infects the cells which line the female reproductive tract and is more easily transmitted during heterosexual vaginal intercourse. Although Thailand has both subtypes B and E, 90% of HIV transmission in the country involves subtype E through heterosexual sex. It remains unclear whether subtype E will develop into a heterosexual epidemic in the US, but given the accelerated rate and ease with which the subtype spreads among heterosexuals, its presence in the US may pose quite a threat to the health of the heterosexually active population. Dr. Max Essex, chairman of the Harvard AIDS Institute, recommends that subtype surveillance studies be conducted on high-risk, low socioeconomic urban populations being tested for STDs including HIV. Although Dr. Gerald Myers, director of the HIV Sequence Database AIDS Project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, believes that the fear of outbreak of subtype E is overly exaggerated, he does agree that countries should expect to see multiple HIV subtypes appear in their populations. These different types of viruses could make it more difficult to develop an effective vaccine against AIDS since most efforts thus far to find an effective vaccine against HIV/AIDS have been directed against subtype B."

While the majority of cases in 1990 were localized in Yunnan among minority farmers and manual laborers, infection is now found in 19 provinces, counties, and urban areas over a wider spectrum of society. The concentration of cases among IV-drug users has decreased from 83.4% to 72.6%. HIV monitoring and prevention stations have been in place in the country since 1986. The government also encouraged special zones and semiautonomous cities as well as the World Health Organization to take steps to monitor and prevent the spread of HIV. While these effort have served to augment the degree of sex education previously provided, low budgets, bureaucracy, and ambivalence have impeded control efforts. Only 1.25 million of the 1.16 billion population has been serosampled over 8 years and 100,000 fewer serosamples were taken in 1992 compared to in 1991. Neither the general population nor health workers have sufficient knowledge about HIV/AIDS to prevent its continued spread. While gay men sampled in Beijing were better informed about transmission means and risk groups, over two thirds believed they were not at risk if they avoided having sex with foreigners. Recent economic reform measures allowing large movements of population from rural to urban areas, increased disposable income available for prostitutes, and greater exposure to alternative sexual norms and behaviors through the media and music further increase the risk of HIV transmission, especially among the younger generation. To counter these risks, an AIDS hotline for information and referrals has been established in Beijing which openly reaches out to the homosexual community and fields 8-12 calls/day. Training programs for doctors, counselors, professors, and social workers have been attended by people from more than 30 provinces and regions. In addition, modest research into sexual behavior is also being conducted at universities. To really fight future HIV infections and AIDS illness, however, more funds must be brought to bear."

        "abstract": "On Cyprus, where the traditional conservatism is reflected in an extreme reluctance to talk about issues such as sex and family planning, the Family Planning Association (FPA) has established drop-in centers for education about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) which are aimed at youth. Fieldworkers tour the island lecturing on AIDS to general audiences, and the FPA has organized special seminars for certain professions. Intense efforts are now under way to establish contact with groups of homosexuals. Drop-in centers, which have had the greatest response, put emphasis on how AIDS is transmitted through sex, especially in view of the great influex of foreign tourists each summer and its effect on the sex behavior of young males. FPA hopes to secure funds to establish such centers for youth in all major towns. A counselling service for AIDS victims is also planned."

        "abstract": "The collaborative efforts of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Indian Government, the Indian Council of Medical Research, and the State Government Health Services have produced a sero-surveillance program for HIV infection in India. Through mid-October, 1987, the program's 36 surveillance centers identified 145 seropositive individuals, and 13 with AIDS, out of a total screened pool of 56,934 considered to be at high-risk of HIV infection. 2/3 male, and 20-30 years, screened individuals were largely blood donors and heterosexually promiscuous men and women seen at STD clinics. Relatively few prostitutes, homosexuals, and IV-drug users have been tested. Health education, counseling, and periodic health check-ups are stressed for all asymptomatic, sero-positive individuals. Overall, sero-surveillance suggests a low prevalence of HIV infection in India even among high risk groups. Heterosexual transmission is the main mode of infection in India, with perinatal exposure to HIV, and transfusions also documented as transmission sources. The screening of blood products for HIV antibodies has been made mandatory by the government of India."

        "title": "This is not only a test. The hidden risks of antibody screening.",
        "abstract": "Interviews with several gay rights activists and public health workers raise serious questions about the blood test to detect antibodies to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). A New York gay activist has described the test as \"the 80's equivalent of the yellow star,\" which stigmatizes people and singles them out for discrimination. Public opinion tends not to make any distinction between a positive test result and full-blown AIDS, and government promotion of the test has not added clarity. Several states require the names and addresses of antibody carriers, while others keep lists of the sexual partners of those who test positive. Concern has been expressed that this trend will have 2 practical effects: people will be reluctant to take the test, and record keeping will lead to other uses. Since identification requirements were instituted in Colorado, voluntary testing at gay health clinics dropped from 600 to 100/month. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has allocated US$20 million for special AIDS antibody screening sites, and the states are spending thousands of dollars to collect statistics on individuals at risk. There is increasing concern, however, that funds that could be used for AIDS education are being diverted to antibody screening programs. In states where AIDS is still relatively new, refusal to fund community-based education efforts is considered especially destructive, since there may be time to stop the virus from infecting large numbers of people. A former government official, who disagrees with the CDC approach, has noted that there are no data to support the contention that testing people makes them change their behavior, while AIDS education has been proven to be an effective means to reduce high risk activities. Finally, there is evidence that a positive antibody test has a profound psychological impact, including anxiety, depression, and withdrawal from social relations."

        "abstract": "While few adolescents world-wide have AIDS, it is estimated that half the people infected with HIV became infected when they were 15-24 years old. Health professionals assert that HIV exists in adolescent populations that are marked by sexually transmitted diseases and/or adolescent pregnancies. Research has revealed that most young people worldwide first experience sexual intercourse while they are in their teens. This situation has been exacerbated by rural-urban migration and the breakdown of traditional sources of information, by the risk-taking nature of adolescence that leads to drug and alcohol abuse, by cultural norms that lead young women to preserve their virginity by engaging in anal sex, by the poverty that causes youth to trade sex for survival. The HIV/AIDS prevention efforts aimed at young people have been successful in increasing their knowledge about transmission of the infection but not in changing their risky behavior. In order to change adolescent social norms, influential young people should be used as peer educators, parents and teachers should be enlisted in prevention efforts, young people should be involved in the planning of the programs, and all of the needs of the adolescents should be addressed. In addition, HIV/AIDS programs must provide services for those youth who are already infected. It is difficult for prevention programs to engage in safer sex training because of a lack of consensus about whether to give adolescents information only or to provide condoms. The AIDS epidemic has at least provided an opportunity for societies to address how sex education should proceed and has given rise to the innovative idea that adolescents require their own health services."

        "abstract": "At least 32 pathogens are known to be spread through sexual transmission. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) cause serious health problems that greatly affect the fetus and newborn and often result in both infant and adult death. The spread of STDs can be hindered by examining sexual behavior and attitudes, and by advocating monogamy in relationships as one of the best methods of protections against an STD. As the number of partners increases, so does the risk of transmission. Availability of centers for treatment and detection is another factor able to hinder the spread of disease. Condoms and spermicides offer some protection against STDs, whereas other methods of contraception such as diaphragms and hormonal methods have not been shown to prevent disease transmission. Family planning staff should be aware of the impact of STDs and should be able to make the public aware as well. Factors such as sexual background and behavior should be considered when recommending a form of contraception. Education, training and counselling are all crucial components of a successful family planning clinic and further promote safe sex practices."

Thailand is an example of a society where few people have many sex partners, a situation with a faster transmission of HIV than a case where most people have few partners. While Asia has lagged behind other regions in the spread of AIDS, in Thailand HIV has spread rapidly since 1988. Thailand has an illegal but tolerated commercial sex industry, with outlets very diverse in terms of STD control. This industry caters to tourists from other Asian countries, and is maintained by a strong male dominant culture, incomes averaging 25 times higher than other occupations pay, depression in outlying areas encouraging remittance of money back to families, and even status for sex workers in the marriage market. There is an entrenched subculture of intravenous drug injectors who also make up a nucleus of HIV carriers with high prevalence, 43% as of 1988. Some strategies open to the government to control spread of HIV include legalization and control of the sex industry, needle/syringe exchange and health care for drug injectors, social welfare for opium growers in the hills, and political solutions for the conflicts affecting drug traffic in Burma."

        "abstract": "Indicating a worsening of the AIDS epidemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has revised its previous estimate of HIV-infected people from 6-8 million to 8-10 million worldwide. Developing countries, especially countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, account for most of the increase in the rate of infection. According to WHO estimates, the number of HIV-infected people in sub-Saharan Africa has increased from 2.5 million in 1987 to around 5 million today. WHO believes that approximately 1 in 40 adult men and women in this region is infected with HIV, up from 1 in 50 in 1987. Additionally, while in 1987 most of the cases were found in urban areas, rural areas are now reporting a significant number of infections. In Asia, a region that had reported virtually no HIV infections as recently as 2 years ago, there now appears to be 1/2 million people infected with the virus. Injecting drug users and prostitutes account for most of the new cases. In the developed world, the rate of new HIV infections appears to be slowing, but WHO warns against complacency, since many groups in this region may yet see an increase in the rate of infection. Furthermore, WHO officials point out that the current estimates may need to be revised further upward, fearing that Asia and Latin America will see marked increases in the rate of infection and that the epidemic will continue to expand in sub-Saharan Africa. The new revised figures reflect an increase in heterosexual transmissions worldwide, and WHO expects that this will lead to an increase in AIDS cases among women and children in the 1990s."

        "abstract": "Worldwide, many thousands of soldiers are infected with HIV. Their actual or potential presence within the ranks of military forces may generate anxiety among military leaders and general personnel. Troops may be concerned over the risk of being infected with HIV through emergency front-line blood transfusions. Leaders and politicians worry about HIV in the military for more political and cultural reasons, including the potential fallout of being accused of sending troops to spread AIDS on foreign peace-keeping missions. US chiefs of staff have even accused HIV+ servicemen of being comparatively unstable, and that they constitute a security risk, especially where control over nuclear armaments is concerned. These concerns fuel the U.S. military argument for expelling homosexuals from service. Over 13,000 troops identified as homosexual were expelled from the Navy over the period 1982-91. $27 million were spent in 1990 to replace identified gay soldiers. HIV is prevalent to varying degrees in virtually every army in the world. AIDS has decimated some African armies. 1 sub-Saharan country has lost so many pilots to AIDS that it has reportedly recruited soldiers from Yugoslavia to compensate for the loss. Uganda's army may have a 20% prevalence of HIV. War is the harbinger of AIDS; as populations are displaced during war, servicemen turn to prostitutes for sex, and women sell sex to provide their families. Wartime rapes spread HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. While the military may contribute to the spread of HIV, it also has the capacity to help prevent transmission. Mandatory HIV-antibody testing is many armies may help research and practical efforts to monitor and control HIV prevalence and incidence in populations. Additional steps may be and have been taken by military forces to educate the public and promote and develop AIDS control programs."

In a baseline study on knowledge, behavior and practice among target groups, results showed that general knowledge about sexually transmitted disease and HIV/AIDS is very poor in these groups. In addition, there is a continued practice of risky behaviors, which could lead to HIV infection among these groups. In view of such, drama presentations were undertaken to disseminate information to specific audiences. Scripts and songs were written and a flip chart was created to show the statistics on HIV/AIDS. In addition, role playing, which included references to factors facilitating the transmission of HIV was given. In 1998, a total of performances were given to over 3000 people: 12 for transport industry and sex workers, and 2 for general communities. Moreover, two other local theater groups were trained on HIV/AIDS topics."

Few, however, are voluntary prostitutes. Many people who work as prostitutes have been recruited from the provinces, kept in conditions similar to slavery, and forced to earn money from prostitution to pay for their transportation, board, and lodging. Many prostitutes work in urban centers and tourist resorts in the countryside. During the 1970s, then President Ferdinand Marcos promoted tourism as a major industry, effectively marketing attractive Filipinas to tourists. Sex tourism has flourished in the country ever since. Thousands of prostitutes are also located in Olongapo and Angeles, 2 cities north of Manila, from where they serve the sexual desires of US military personnel. The presence of US military personnel in the Philippines has always been associated with prostitution. The country's social hygiene centers, prostitutes in Manila and Davao, and AIDS education are briefly discussed."

        "abstract": "This article reviews current research evidence on the natural history, epidemiology, and clinical features of acquired immunodeficiency disease (AIDS) and presents guidelines for controlling the sexual transmission of human lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) infection. The rapid spread of HTLV-III infection through homosexual communities in the US and Europe and its association with promiscuity initially obscured the fact that heterosexual transmission is also a significant risk factor for infection. Public health workers and epidemiologists are examining which sexual practices are most associated with the transmission of HTLV-III infection. Case-control studies in homosexuals have suggested that promiscuity, passive anal intercourse, and other sexual practices associated with rectal trauma and bleeding correlate with infection. Similar studies involving heterosexuals have not been conducted. However, the following guidelines have been proposed for couples where 1 partner has been found to be positive for HTLV-III antibodies: 1) sexual partners should be confined to established relationships; 2) anal intercourse should be avoided, even if the male uses a condom; 3) no oral contact with semen should occur; 4) if vaginal intercourse is practiced, the use of condom is essential; and 5) the only practices that are free from risk of infection are mutual masturbation and hand caresses. Since a high proportion of children of women with HTLV-III develop severe immunodeficiency, it is undesirable for women who are HTLV-III antibody positive to become pregnant. Furthermore, there is evidence that women who are HTLV-III antibody positive are more likely to develop AIDS if they become pregnant. A reliable method of permanent or reversible contraception is recommended for these women. Finally, men who are antibody positive should not donate sperm to a sperm bank."

The impacts of AIDS range from social, cultural, psychological to the economic and political. The World Health Organization (WHO) has mobilized international and national interest and resources to work on AIDS control and prevention. AIDS spreads in 3 ways mother to child, through blood, and sexually. Screening blood supplies can prevent the spread of AIDS. In 1987, 105 countries reported 49,132 cases to WHO, and estimated indicated over 100,000 cases. WHO estimate that by 1991 there will be over 1 million cases worldwide. Infant mortality rates due to AIDS may be 10-20/1000 births where 10% of pregnant women are infected. Homosexual, or bisexual men and intravenous drug users from 20 to 49 year old make up most of the cases of AIDS in North and South America, Europe, and Australia. It is estimated that Africa has over 1 million AIDS infected people but accurate counts are not available. There have been a small number of cases reported in Asia, and most of these have resulted from contaminated blood. It is currently estimated that 10- 30% of HIV infected persons will develop AIDS, and 25-50% will develop an AIDS related disease within 5 years. The majority of HIV infected persons will develop AIDS within 10 years and the rest, AIDS related diseases. The cost of a patient can run for $50,000-150,000 in direct medical care in industrialized countries. Since most of the people infected are from 20-49 years of age, their most productive years, a country's social and economic development is threatened. Education is presently the only way to prevent the spread of AIDS, and therefore all governments, as well as health and medical professional must make a extraordinary commitment."

        "abstract": "HIV/AIDS control policy in China focuses on high risk populations. The public security system is intricately intertwined with the Chinese government's HIV control activities. The government can justify its control of high risk activities because prostitution, related trafficking in females, drug abuse, and drug trafficking are elements of the Six Evils: social problems considered to be pre-revolutionary, influenced by decadent western morality, and incompatible with modernization. Public security campaigns involve arresting tens of thousands of people annually in the combined efforts against HIV and the social evils. Instigators of crime are given punitive prison sentences. For their victims, however, incarceration leans toward treatment. The moral-rehabilitative philosophy is the normative foundation of the Chinese criminal justice process. Confucian thought holds that teaching the disobedient person proper social conduct, not punishment, will effect endless change. So correction officials use patient persuasion and re-education with most criminals. The public security system coercively collects drug abusers for as much as three months of counseling and detoxification (methadone or clonidine). The police detain prostitutes for 6 months to 2 years for re-education, including legal indoctrination, labor, and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. Family members and community groups participate in treatment and aftercare. All drug abusers and prostitutes undergo HIV testing. HIV-positive offenders are separated from HIV-negative offenders. Pimps, panderers, or traffickers in females or drugs are either executed or put in prison for at least 10 years. A weakness of China's approach is its exclusive focus on high-risk groups rather than on high-risk practices. This approach assumes HIV will be restricted to these groups. Police will likely increase its punitive and regressive responses to group members as its approach fails to prevent HIV transmission."

Researchers compared these results with those of 10 healthy heterosexual controls. Even though NK cells of the HIV+AS cases were present in the same numbers and functioned as well as those in the controls, an inducer of interferon (Concanavalin A or ConA) could not force the cell system in vitro which demonstrated NK defectiveness. NK response to ConA of HIV+AS cases was lower than that of the healthy controls (p.05). On the other hand, the NK response to a prostaglandin antagonist (Indomethacin or IM) matched that of the healthy controls. Cell supernatants from normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells increased normal NK cell function (p.001), but those from HIV+AS cases did not do so. Thus it appeared that the HIV+AS cases were unable to produce sufficient NK enhancer factors. Cell supernatants from HIV+AS reduced normal NKC below baseline (p.05) indicating the presence of NK suppressor factors. The researchers believed products of the arachidonic acid metabolism by the cyclooexgenase pathway, maybe PGE2, may have contributed to NK suppression since IM negated suppressor activity of cell supernatants from HIV+AS subjects on normal NK function. They concluded that reduced production of enhancing factors, additional release of inhibitory factors, and deficiency at the NK effector system are likely to be the underlying causes for NK deficient function in AIDS. They noted that these effects function synergistically."

The purpose was to ascertain whether young Canadian adults were adjusting their sexual behavior in the direction advocated by the 3 safer sex guidelines promoted in the Canadian AIDS prevention campaigns of 1985 and 1989. The guidelines included 1) abstaining from vaginal and anal intercourse, 2) engaging in a mutually monogamous relationship where the sexual and drug history of the partner is known and there is no potential exposure to HIV, or 3) alternatively guideline to 2, using condoms. Another goal was to establish a data base of cross sections of young adults who were highly motivated to obtain information about sexuality. Reports of samples from 1981 and 885 are those of sexual conduct prior to educational campaigns. By 1988, the students were aware of HIV transmission and prevention. The response rate was 94% for the self-administered questionnaire. The survey included 564 respondents in 1981, 241 in 1983, 234 in 1985, and 259 in 1988. Comparisons were made to the general population at CEGEP. There were no gender, age, or linguistic differences among the population surveyed. The underlying assumption was that people have sufficient knowledge to act in a manner to reduce transmission of HIV. Knowledge of HIV in 1988 was based on 10 questions adapted from the work of Joseph, and DiClemente, Zorn, and Temoshok. 4 independent variables were included in the analysis: year of survey, gender, standards of permission for coitus, and current relationship. Dependent variables were based on 7 dichotomized indicators of compliance with the safer sex guidelines on abstention, mutual monogamy, or condom use. Based on logic analysis an log linear technique, the most parsimonious model was developed and the changes in the relationship between the dependent and independent variables were examined. The results confirm and expand upon earlier findings. Knowledge about AIDS is accurate but does not lead to effective risk reduction. There was no significant change in the safe sex guidelines in 1988. Young adults were found to be not protecting themselves from sexual transmission of HIV in the following ways. 1) There is only temporary abstention from coitus. 2) There is no decrease in multiple partner sex. 3) There is no decrease in nonrelationship coitus. 4) There is no evidence of a shift away from permissiveness prior to marriage or permissiveness whether there is affection or not. The only evidence of safer sex is an increase in the likelihood that condoms have been used at some time."

Effective and just laws to slow the spread of AIDS must therefore be based upon a thorough knowledge of the issues, not upon ignorance, fear, political expediency, or to meet the emotional demands of an often ignorant general population. Good laws, like good ethics, are founded in good data. The most effective response to the AIDS epidemic is neither prohibition nor punishment of individual behavior, but laws designed to truly affect human behavior and shape a society in which the spread of HIV is minimized. Central to an appropriate legislative response is the imperative of protecting the basic rights of individuals infected with HIV. An example of an enlightened, rational, and nondiscriminatory approach to checking the spread of HIV/AIDS while guaranteeing individual freedoms and rights is found in a report commissioned for the State Government of New South Wales. The following measures are recommended to bring state laws into harmony with the national HIV/AIDS strategy: decriminalize brothels, set regulations and public health standards for sex workers, cover sex workers under the Industrial Relations Act, ensure the privacy of HIV/AIDS patients and improve their redress against discrimination in the workplace, repeal laws which make it illegal to possess and administer drugs to oneself, investigate the therapeutic use of marijuana as a prescribed treatment for HIV/AIDS and other terminal illnesses, abandon compulsory testing for HIV in prisons, make condoms available to prisoners and sexually active children, establish a Natural Death Act to allow terminally ill patients to die with dignity, and give legal status to permanent relationships between homosexual couples."

Apart from receiving the trial microbicide or a placebo, participants also received classical HIV prevention support, such as free condoms, free treatment for sexually transmitted infections, counseling, and peer support. One positive outcome of the trial is that fewer of the sex workers who participated became infected with HIV, compared with the sex workers who did not participate at all in the study. However, Piot states that even if the results of the trials are disappointing, the search for an effective microbicide continues. To this effect, at least 36 compounds are at the preclinical testing stage, while 20 are ready for early safety trials in human volunteers and three additional compounds are being considered for large-scale trials."

Among 370 Russian high school students surveyed only 25% of the girls and 35% of the boys knew that condoms were intended for only a single occasion of use. A survey in 17 high schools in Bucharest showed that lack of information on reproductive health was one of the main reasons for unplanned pregnancies and abortion among Rumanian youth. Lack of vital information is one of the reasons for the low use of family planning among adolescents. The evaluation of sex education among young adults shows that formal sex education programs can increase the knowledge of reproductive health. In Tanzania a school-based program for students 13-15 years old showed an increase in knowledge about AIDS and decrease in those wanting to have sex. Attaining behavior change is the focus of these programs, but few studies deal with the results of sex education. Several family planning programs have incorporated elements of behavior change into sex education programs for young people, e.g., the Planning your Life program in Mexico, with information about pregnancy, disease prevention and STDs, relationships, decision-making, communication, and assertiveness. The Sexuality Information and Education Council lists concepts in a comprehensive sex education program: human development, relationships, personal skills, sexual behavior, sexual health, and society and culture."

        "abstract": "9 million of the estimated 14 million HIV infections worldwide are in sub-Saharan Africa. More than 75% of HIV cases in sub-Saharan Africa are transmitted through heterosexual sex and the male-to-female infection ratio is approximately one to one. In many African countries, a considerable proportion of married men live away from their wives due to the need to either migrate or continually travel for employment. Examples include miners residing in camps near their workplace and long-distance truck drivers. While away from home, some of these men have sex with commercial sex workers. The limited economic opportunities for women in rural and urban areas have created a large underclass of women willing to prostitute themselves for survival. These economic, cultural, and geographic circumstances mean that many men have sex with a relatively small pool of women, core transmitters of HIV. Once infected, men infect their wives, thereby propagating the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The role of information, education, and communication, and lessons learned from intervention programs are explored."

        "abstract": "The cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), has been identified by 2 types: HIV 1 and HIV 2. Detection is done through blood testing and is difficult to diagnosis by symptoms because the disease has a latency period. 28 countries in Europe and the surrounding Mediterranean area reported a total of 10,181 cases of AIDS by December 31, 1987. The largest percentage of cases are in the sexually active category, and the number of cases among heterosexuals is growing rapidly. Family planning staff are in the position to provide information about disease transmission and AIDS prevention. Concerning AIDS testing, information that details the benefits and problems of testing and diagnoses should be discussed. Patients who test positively should be counselled and given follow-up examinations. \"Safer sex\" is identified as sexual interaction without fluid interchange. For those who chose to have vaginal intercourse, methods such as condoms and spermicides should be used to minimize risk. The use of these methods should be emphasized if 1 in a partnership is infected or if the individual is sexually active. Condoms and spermicides are the most effective methods as oral contraceptives have no preventive abilities and the IUD has proven to exacerbate the spread of disease. Women at risk should understand that there is a 30-50% chance of passing the disease on in pregnancy to a fetus and that HIV infection increases the risk of hepatitis B and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)."

This is most noticeable in the north, where three adjoining provinces have been noted as the center of the Thai HIV/AIDS epidemic. The provinces of Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and Phayao have been expanding centers of trade, which includes smuggling and other illicit activities. These internal and cross-border sites are clearly linked with economic development, trade, and sexual services, subsequently contributing to the spread of HIV in Thailand and beyond. In view of such, it is recommended that internal migration and mobility must be examined for risk situations and the factors that make people vulnerable. Cross-border migrants also need to be studied in their places of origin, the routes they take and their destination points."

        "abstract": "South Africa's long isolation, and perhaps deliberate efforts by the apartheid government, have led to an unusual pattern of drug abuse in the country. Drugs not commonly used in other countries, such as Mandrax and Welconol, are widespread in South Africa, while the street drugs commonly found in other countries, such as cocaine and heroin, have been relatively rare. However, this is changing, as international drug traffickers now import a broad range of drugs, including heroin and cocaine. Demand for these drugs has been established in South Africa, including among the urban lower classes. Immigration, especially of other Africans and particularly Nigerians, has accelerated the trend. While both mandrax and crack cocaine are smoked, the former is a sedative and the latter is a stimulant with pro-sexual effects. These sexual effects, together with very strong addictive potential, have led to very high HIV seroprevalence in user populations. Addiction often leads female users into prostitution, with prostitutes being a prime conduit for the spread of both the drug and HIV infection. Desperate to earn funds to meet their crack consumption needs, drug-addicted female prostitutes in South Africa service many clients and engage in practices shunned by their nonaddicted peers, such as unprotected and anal sex. There will be serious long-term effects of crack cocaine consumption, together with prostitution, upon all of South African society."

An estimated 6-9 billion condoms are currently used throughout the world each year. However, a report from the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health has determined that the level of condom use must be increased to 24 billion units annually in order to check the spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. An estimated 71% of total condom need is among sexually active unmarried men, while the rest of the need is among married men who have extramarital affairs and by married couples. Condoms should be made accessible to all at subsidized prices and provided not only through health clinics and retail shops, but also in hotels, bars, grocery stores, and vending machines. New efforts are needed to make condoms more accessible, including lowering their cost, effectively promoting their use, and overcoming the many social and personal obstacles to their use, especially in developing countries where the impact of AIDS is the most severe. Special programs should target specific groups, including youth, unmarried men, and prostitutes, while condom promotion should also aim to improve the image of condoms by portraying them as fun, reliable, and important. Finally, political and religious leaders should speak out in favor of condom use, while the mass media should openly discuss condoms."

        "abstract": "HIV has been reported in the capital city of Cambodia, Phnom Penh, as well as in the northwestern provinces of Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Pursat, and Kompong Chhnang. Unofficial reports indicate the presence of HIV in three northeastern provinces. According to World Health Organization data, 382 people were infected with HIV in Cambodia as of March 1994, but the national AIDS program estimates that 2000-4000 Cambodians may be HIV-seropositive. Small surveys in 1992 identified HIV infection rates to be 4.5% among patients of sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics and 9.2% among prostitutes. A seroprevalence rate of 4.3% was found in 1993 among clients of STD clinics and others requesting HIV testing. These rather marked levels of infection exist in Cambodia even though HIV was first identified in the country as recently as 1991 among screened blood from volunteer donors. By December 1993, the rate of positive results from blood donors had increased to 1.97%.; the rate of infection among blood donors is expected to double to approximately 4% in 1994. People in Cambodia variously believe that AIDS is nonexistent, AIDS is a problem of other countries, can be transmitted by mosquitoes, healthy people do not have AIDS, a cure exists for AIDS, AIDS can be contracted only from prostitutes, AIDS is the most severe state of syphilis, and AIDS is only a propaganda ploy of condom producers to market their products. It is therefore proving extremely difficult to convince people that AIDS is a truly threatening disease against which they should protect themselves, especially when symptoms are rarely present during the early stage of infection. Health education campaigns, videos, posters, and accurate reporting in the media will, however, help change minds and hopefully induce HIV-preventive behaviors. Of interest, the article notes that virtually every prostitute in Cambodia has at least two-three STDs."

Furthermore, key influential individuals must be encouraged to get involved in bringing about positive change in social influences and local policy.

        "abstract": "Dr. Phyllis Kanki, a scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health, states that her 9-year study of prostitutes in Senegal showed that those women who were infected with HIV-2, a weaker strain of HIV, were approximately 70% less likely to acquire HIV-1. HIV-2 can cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), but it is much less virulent and much less aggressive. Persons who are infected with HIV-2 may take 25 years to develop AIDS, while those with HIV-1 die from the disease in half that time. HIV-2 is less infectious than HIV-1 and has not spread worldwide. Kanki's study, which was published in the June 16, 1995 issue of \"Science,\" followed the health of 756 prostitutes in Dakar, Senegal; 138 women had HIV-2 initially, while 618 had neither type of HIV. After 9 years, the former group experienced less than one-third of the HIV-1 infections that developed in the latter group. The difference was not due to an increase in the practice of safe sex; the former group developed 50% more gonorrhea than the other group, which indicates there was no change in behavior. Since HIV-2 is a retrovirus that would never leave the body, that could change genetically into a more aggressive virus over time, and that could cause cancer, it is not a good vaccine candidate for HIV-1. However, HIV-2 infection trains the immune system to respond more rapidly and aggressively against HIV-1; knowing what causes this reaction could lead to a vaccine."

Approximately 50 simultaneous police raids were conducted in a 1-hour period on February 5th during which 437 female alleged child sex workers were detained for rescue. None were produced in court within 24 hours of their detention, against Indian law. While a police surgeon determined the majority to be under age 18 years, the women's backgrounds and histories make it likely that many are actually age 18 years and older. The justices have argued that even the women of majority age should be detained for rehabilitation. These detainees have since been discriminated against and subjected to mandatory HIV testing without their informed consent, inhumane living conditions, and violations of their fundamental rights. The de facto imprisonment of these women violates their rights of freedom of movement, freedom of association, and freedom of residence. The Indian Health Organization and Counseling and Allied Services for AIDS have been making regular weekly visits to provide medical and counseling services to the women. There is strong clinical suspicion that 65-70% of the detainees are HIV-positive, 62% are undergoing treatment for other sexually transmitted diseases, and 85% have nonsexually transmitted diseases such as tuberculosis. All require immediate medical attention. Some women have been sent under police escort to institutions or their families in their countries of origin. 236 mainly Nepalese women remain in six remand homes in and around Bombay awaiting court decisions on their futures."

        "abstract": "Thika, Kenya, is an industrial town where many single male workers and bus drivers frequently stop during long distance trips. As such, the town was chosen as a site for various AIDS educational and condom distribution programs. Karina Kielmann of the Johns Hopkins University presented a paper examining the social impact of an AIDS education program on female prostitutes in Thika. She found the program to be based upon the assumptions that Thika has an identifiable homogenous group of prostitutes and that women with high-risk sex behavior can be taught to lower their levels of risk. In her interviews with women living in Thika, however, Kielmann found that the Western notion of prostitution simply did not apply to the quasi-commercial sexual relationships in which the women were involved. Relationships among these women were of many different types and duration, and not at all homogeneous within the group. Insofar as the ability and desire for these women to change their behavior, the majority of them are socioeconomically and legally marginalized, with little control over decision relating to sexuality. Moreover, most sexual health problems are so stigmatized that many women avoid the government services available near them. Maternal-child health and family planning clinics fail to meet their needs due to shortages of supplies, medicine, and staff. Women did not identify themselves as prostitutes, so significant behavior change did not occur as aa result of the prevention program. Kielmann's study raises questions about the notions of prostitution, risk, and responsibility as used in the medical discourse of AIDS education."

There is little in-depth research on the prevalence of HIV/AIDS. After the collapse of the USSR, the opening up of borders presented greater options for the spread of HIV. During 1991-1996, HIV-infected persons increased from 0.3/100,000 to 7.8/100,000. Syphilis and gonorrhea also spread in the 1990s. The increased prevalence is attributed to changes in sexual behavior due to increased travel and migration, disruption among families, and changes in sexual mores; and changes in the structure, availability, and effectiveness of health services. Many migrants in the CIS are young people. Mobile populations in the CIS include labor migrants, refugees, persons displaced by armed conflicts, repatriates, forced migrants, resettlement of formerly deported persons, and ecological migrants. It is general knowledge that migrants are poorly informed about HIV/AIDS. Condoms are not readily available in the CIS. Eastern Europe has high rates of HIV among migrant sex workers."

This proposal was raised in the light of the growing HIV and STD global concern and the use of contraceptive methods for STD prevention. Despite recommendations on using barrier methods for STD/HIV prevention, many family planning providers hesitate about endorsing barrier methods because of lesser efficacy in preventing unintended pregnancies. However, several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of male and female condoms when used consistently and correctly. In addition, accumulated data on condom use and HIV infection revealed that consistent use of male condoms protect against HIV acquisition (protection ranging from 50% to 100%). These findings underscore the effectiveness of condoms in preventing STD/HIV when used consistently and correctly and should be encouraged at every opportunity."

Educators try to effectively communicate values based messages on sexual health, sexuality, and safer sex. Yet reactionaries who tend to attribute widespread moral decadence to sexuality educators are often in positions of power at the state and national levels. They do not realize that at the most only 10% of US children are exposed to anything close to sex education. Most sex education is limited to anatomy and sexual abstinence. Youth need to know about anatomy and that sexual abstinence is preferable but they also need to know how to prevent pregnancy and protect themselves from STDs and AIDS. Sexuality educators are not taking advantage of the fact that most people in the US and Canada (80-86%) approve of sexuality education in the schools including contraception information. Sex education program task forces often try to appease the small number of extremists which results in an effective and potentially harmful program. The 1st step of such a task force should be to outline operational guidelines about closure of debate and the recognition that unanimity is not required or not necessarily always wanted. Sex educators need to communicate that they too favor moral and ethically based sex education. They also need to convey that youth armed with knowledge about sex tend to delay 1st intercourse and to use contraceptives. Sex educators must morally commit to democratic ideals and allow reflection on controversial issues such as abortion. They need to reflect on why they have not been able to move beyond this moralistic position of the extremists and identify strategies to convey safer sex messages.

Culture was defined in this text as the interaction between human beings and various cultural tools; it encodes different meanings, ideologies, and social practices. Among the most pervasive tool people use when constructing their response to AIDS is the notion of culture itself and the system of inclusion and exclusion it provides. Cultural identity can both empower individuals to build strong communities and, at the same time blind them to potential dangers. By locating homosexuality outside of cultural norms of identity and interaction and using global or Western labels and discourses legitimate the notion of homosexual identity, but not in other ways, limits readers' participation in Chinese culture. There is a need to further explore the effect of culture on HIV/AIDS prevention; it must take into account what culture means. For culture is not a solid, concrete thing that people possess or live inside, but rather it is dynamic phenomena which is continually being constructed as individuals mix and adapt various and competing discourses in response to specific situations."

The government is investing in newspaper advertising in order to prevent the spread of AIDS, because the alternative health care model is too expensive. The country is unable to afford the expensive drugs for treating AIDS and HIV infections, and the health care system, in general, is in decline. The health ministry is relying on the support from Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders) to mount a newspaper campaign to urge condom use and other safe sex practices. The campaign will also involve television and radio advertisements, followed by billboards on subway stops and city buses. Since the communist break-up, IV drug use and prostitution have become widespread problems. Borders were opened, and drugs entered the country. Under the former Soviet regime, contact with foreigners was discouraged and travel was restricted. The public was exposed to AIDS information in the campaigns conducted in 1990. The public is generally informed about AIDS. The new campaign focuses on safe sex, which is a new concept for Russians. There is a wide gap between knowledge and adoption of safe sex practices. Official records indicate about 4400 HIV cases, of which 259 are in advanced stages of AIDS. Official figures are considered underestimates. Over 75% of current HIV cases involve IV drug users, but the potential for heterosexual transmission is great. About 50% of the HIV cases were recorded in Kaliningrad, a port city with a growing population of IV drug users. The city provides easy access to the rest of Europe and exposure to HIV/AIDS that is not yet found in most other Russian cities."

Many Thai men go to these establishments on a regular basis, with almost 100% of male sexually transmitted disease (STD) patients reporting that they contracted the infection(s) from sex workers. Information, education, and communication programs were first employed to encourage greater condom use and other HIV preventive changes in sexual behavior. While many sex workers reported the desire for their clients to use condoms, some clients refused and workers were ultimately pressured into complying with the wishes of clients to engage in unprotected sex. In response, public health officials, police, and representatives of local government met with the owners of commercial sex establishments in the Ratchaburi province south of Bangkok in 1989. Owners were provided with information on AIDS and encouraged to withhold sex services from clients who refuse to use condoms. Establishments would be monitored, penalized, and potentially shut down for failure to comply with the \"100 percent\" program. Monitoring approaches include asking clients in STD clinics where they last had sex with a prostitute; sending volunteers to test compliance; observing STD infection rates among sex workers receiving routine examinations at local clinics; and monitoring the number of condoms provided per establishment. The success of this program prompted its extension to other provinces and ultimate nationwide expansion in 1991 as called for by the National AIDS Committee. By July 1992, the program had been implemented in all 73 provinces. A marked increase in condom use has been observed in the establishments, with some levels reaching 90% last summer. Moreover, the incidence of STDs has decreased steadily from 6.5 infections/1000 population to 2.1/1000 over the period 1989-92. It is, however, still too early to say whether the program has helped reduce the transmission of HIV."

The extent of heterosexual HIV transmission will likely increase in Western countries.

Study participants were recruited at discotheques and bars catering to single adults. Respondents' attitudes toward safe sex were generally positive, although those attitudes were not always reflected in actual sexual practice. High levels of sexual activity were reported, including high risk behaviors such as unprotected anal sex with casual and regular partners by both men and women. Situational and partner characteristics frustrated the practice of safe sex despite intentions to use condoms. Few men and half of the women explicitly discussed condom use with their sex partners.

In the absence of sustained guidance in the campaign against AIDS, responsibility has fallen to voluntary health activists who have become catalysts for community awareness and participation. This voluntary initiative, in effect, seems to be the only immediate avenue for constructive public action, and signals the gradual development of an AIDS network in India. Proceedings from a seminar in Ahmedabad are discussed, and include plans for an information and education program targeting sex workers, health and communication programs for 150 commercial blood donors and their agents, surveillance and awareness programs for safer blood and blood products, and dialogue with the business community and trade unions. Despite the lack of coordination among volunteers and activists, every major city in India now has an AIDS group.

For example, 39 of 121 sex workers studied claimed to have begun working as a prostitute after their trading businesses collapsed. Study findings suggest a high level of AIDS awareness among Ghanaian prostitutes. Prostitutes in Ghana are considered to be either seaters or roamers. Seaters are a loosely organized group of women who tend to work from a common compound, attracting customers by sitting in the doorway of their rooms. They typically report to an older retired sex worker who settles disputes and raises credit if one of the women must pay a police fine. Seaters are largely 30-45 years old and work in industrial centers. Roamers, however, tend to be 20-30 years old, work in coastal towns, and are usually better educated. They move from place to place and are probably at lower risk of contracting HIV due to the higher rates they charge and the correspondingly lower number of clients they entertain. Roamers seem to have higher rates of condom use and clients who are aware of the dangers. Roamers, too, are not organized as a group and may even often be highly competitive. Their work in the isolation of hotels makes them particularly vulnerable. Economic necessity has therefore increasingly drawn Ghanaian women into the sex trade, while Ghanaian men who typically support two or three women in exchange for sex, but can no longer do so due to current economic conditions, turn to occasional sex with prostitutes. This paper notes that informal prostitution often paid in kind rather than cash also exists in Ghana. Before the recent nationwide growth in prostitution, most sex workers came from the Krobo tribe in eastern Ghana due most likely to a combination of economic and cultural factors. Increasing numbers now come from the central Ashanti region. Mention is made of the Akosombo Dam project during the 1960s which drew large numbers of women into prostitution to serve the desires of the thousands of migrant construction workers."

        "abstract": "Young women who have sex with men are vulnerable to infection with HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), because of both the potential presence of infectious organisms and young women's lack of appropriate and effective personal skills in asserting their relationship needs, and their needs for protection against infection. The increasing incidence of STDs, including HIV, in young women would reduce if the women could be enabled to develop techniques, such as the communication, negotiation, and assertiveness skills needed to manage their sexual health within a heterosexual relationship. One obstacle to bringing about substantive changes in heterosexual behavior is that STDs are not fully acknowledged as a public health issue by non-gay people. However, an overwhelming body of evidence from sources around the world shows that STDs are mainly infections of heterosexual people aged 15-30 years, and that the concept of a risk group is unsound for educational purposes. Risk behavior is what matters. Other obstacles include the belief among many that heterosexual behavior is natural, and that sex must be penetrative; serial monogamy; lack of frank communication between sex partners; the absence of a heterosexual community; and current economic and political circumstances."

For AIDS patients it must teach responsibility for not transmitting the disease to others as well as encouraging self-help support groups.

Liability would be greater for convicted HIV-seropositive rapists. The South African AIDS Legal Network is opposed to legislation which specifically criminalizes the transmission of HIV. Such legislation will not help curb the spread of HIV, but simply discourage people from seeking education, counseling, and treatment, violate human rights, and fuel the stigmatization of people with HIV/AIDS. The Network encourages all who are opposed to Zimbabwe's proposal to voice their opinion before other such legislation is proposed and adopted elsewhere in Africa. A Cameroonian barrister at a recent meeting of the Cameroon Medical Women's Association noted that the country's penal code allows for the imprisonment of anyone who facilitates the spread of any dangerous infectious disease, including sexually transmitted diseases."

Actual figures of numbers of condoms distributed by the PPFN are down from 142,000 in 1985 to 132,000 in 1986, because of a hitch in supplies from international donors. Condoms are sold for the nominal price of 4 for 50 kobo, or free of charge during demonstrations by organizations. A list of tips on proper condom use is given. Although condoms are known to protect against AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases, most Nigerians will only use them as a last resort. They prefer to buy antibiotic capsules from street vendors after unprotected intercourse. Hopefully the mounting AIDS epidemic will change this practice."

By promoting condom usage as a contraceptive method and a preventive method against sexually transmitted diseases, family planning programs could effectively involve men in practicing safe sex. Some misconceptions among men about this contraceptive barrier include decreased sexual sensations during intercourse, partners being offended, and disruption of sexual intercourse. To increase their usage, programs must focus on creating a positive image of the condom. Advantages include no side-effects, easy use, and protection against unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. Proper condom use should be emphasized to increase its usage among men. Condoms could be made more accessible through vending machines or community-based distribution centers. Male sex and contraceptive knowledge may be further enhanced by employing males counselors to train man in contraceptive and preventive measures. 2 organizations which have effectively involved men in promoting safe sex are The Planned Parenthood Association of Ghana (PPAG) and The Family Planning Association of Nepal (FPAN). PPAG integrates sex and health education with recreation. FPAN promotes condom usage through health and social services, media, and condom dispensers.

        "title": "AIDS: the frightening facts.",
        "abstract": "Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has succeeded in creating an unprecedented wave of panic among the Western public and some sections of the medical profession. Research clearly shows that the AIDS virus is transmissible in a number of ways: from man to woman and vice versa during sexual intercourse, through semen and possibly vaginal fluids; from mothers to their children through breast milk; through exchange of saliva (but not through just a casual kiss); and through blood and blood products. Far from being exclusive to homosexuals, studies in Europe have shown that female virus carriers can transmit AIDS to healthy men through sexual intercourse--the predominant means by which transmission appears to occur in Central Africa. Although cases of AIDS began being diagnosed in a few Central African countries at the beginning of the 1980s, at the same time as they were first being observed in Europe and North America, many commentators assumed that the virus originated in Africa. Yet, it is safe to say that the nature of the virus, let alone its origins, remains controversial among scientists and virologists. 1 supporter of the theory that the AIDS virus has African origins is Robert Gall of the US National Institute of Health (NIH). He is one of the co-discoverers of the virus, which he named HTLV3 (Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus 3). The virus also was discovered at France's Pasteur Institute by Luc Montaigner, who called it LAV (Lymphadenpathy Associated Virus). Gallo named the virus as he did because he believes it to be related to a pair of other viruses, HTLV1 and HTLV2, which like the AIDS virus attack the body's immunity system. Unlike AIDS, these 2 viruses, do not destroy the T-cells but cause them to replicate into cancer tumors. In Gallo's view, HTLV1 has long been endemic to some parts of Africa, from where he believes it spread via the slave trade to other parts of the world. Montaigner does not agree. He denies that the AIDS virus is related to either HTLV1 or HTLV2, claiming that ist shape and behavior makes it closer to a group of viruses known as lenti-viruses, so called because they can lie dormant in an animal host for between 5-20 years before becoming active. Prior to the appearance of AIDS, lenti-viruses were hardly ever found in humans. Due to this controversy, the virus has been HTLV3/LAV by the scientific community. What is evident from studies of the disease in Africa, Europe, and the US, is that there are no easy remedies for this highly complex syndrome. Nor is it possible to generalize about it from 1 country to another, let alone 1 continent from another. The way the disease presents itself in Zaire is different from the way it presents itself in Uganda, and both are very different from the way it presents itself in Europe and the US. In Zaire, chronic diarrhea, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and cryptococcal meningitis could all be symptoms of the AIDS patient. AIDS is a recognized public health problem in a number of Central African countries. In those areas where the disease's presence has been confirmed, sexual promiscuity has been singled out as a high risk factor for its transmission. In all affected countries, health authorities are aware of the need to launch health education campaigns."

        "abstract": "Hatred and fear of homosexuals, together with a fear of losing tourism revenue, drove many high-level policymakers in the Caribbean to ignore the HIV/AIDS in its infancy. With an annual incidence rate of at least 146.6 people per 100,000, the Bahamas now has one of the highest AIDS rates in the world and the highest such rate in the English-speaking Caribbean. AIDS has become the major cause of death for men and women aged 20-44 in the Bahamas. Indeed, throughout the Caribbean, countries like the Bahamas must now cope with a growing AIDS epidemic. UN AIDS Program figures indicate that at least 310,000 people in the Caribbean have either HIV infection or AIDS, and that the prevalence rate among adults is almost 2%. This compares with an estimated 7.4% of the adult population of sub-Saharan Africa which is infected and 0.6% of adults in North America. 65% of reported AIDS cases in the region result from heterosexual intercourse. While the annual number of AIDS cases has been falling in North America over the last several years and rates in Latin America have leveled off, rates in the Caribbean are increasing sharply. Poverty, the population's lack of awareness, low levels of education, internal and international migration, crack cocaine use, promiscuity, high levels of STDs, prostitution, and tourism are also facilitating the spread of HIV in the Caribbean. Social conservatism, mainly in the English-Caribbean, about discussing sex impedes the implementation and success of HIV/AIDS prevention interventions."

Men favored its use compared to male condoms since it does not interrupt sexual activity and feels more similar to unprotected sex. Results from international studies on the efficacy of female condoms include: 1) ability to prevent unwanted pregnancies; 2) ability to prevent transmission of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV; 3) expansion of choice in increasing protection; 4) acceptability of the female condom to a wide range of men and women; 4) safety of the product; 5) easier use through constant practice; 6) provision of additional emotional comfort, sense of security and control; 7) cost-effectiveness as a prevention program; and 8) the need for a more strategic introduction in other countries. The establishment of the Female Condom Programming Guide assists with design and implementation of strategies, as well as catalyzing of new ideas and expanding of good practices in female condom programs. This article emphasizes the significance of female condom as an important technology that plays a vital role in the reproductive health programs and needs to be introduced strategically in order to provide the greatest and most cost-effective public health impact."

This research could be realized only owing to support of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USA). The questionnaire covered a broad spectrum of questions on pregnancy and delivery, knowledge and usage of contraceptives, mother and infant health care, the sexual life and contraceptive use of young women (15-24 years old), women's health status, the knowledge of and attitudes toward problems of parenthood, knowledge of HIV/AIDS, as well as socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. 3-stage random sampling (cluster sample) was applied in order to obtain representative results for even small areas. In a total of 12,747 households selected, there were 4870 women 15-44 years old, of whom 4497 were interviewed. 64% were married, and 3% were living in consensual union. 18% of the women had elementary education and 8% were attending secondary schools. 31% were Roman Catholics and 5% indicated other religions. According to 1992 data, the total fertility rate was a relatively high 1.72 in the country. 69% of married and previously married women were not currently using any type of contraception (75% of couples with 2 or 3 children and 29% of those without children). The use of contraception was more prevalent among educated women. Of all women 18.5% used coitus interruptus, 15.3% used condoms, 11.5% used IUDs, 7.7.% used oral contraceptives, and 1.9% were sterilized. Among those who had 4 or more children, 27% were sterilized. Among girls 17 years of age more than half had had sexual experience, while among 18-year-old girls 87% did. Over 90% used coitus interruptus or the condom during the first intercourse. Only 8 women (less than 1%) out of 1374 studied who gave birth after January 1, 1988, stated that during their pregnancy they did not obtain prenatal care. Rates of smoking during pregnancy were 20-23% in all and up to 32% of single women. There was fairly good knowledge of HIV/AIDS, particularly in Prague."

        "abstract": "Biomedical analyses are primarily concerned with the disinhibiting effects of alcohol and the consequent increased likelihood of engaging in high-risk sexual behavior. However, such an approach ignores indigenous constructions of drinking behavior and sexuality. In northern Thailand, alcohol drinking and sex with prostitutes are closely linked and both are crucial to the construction of the male identity. Sexual encounters with a commercial sex worker generally follow a period of preparatory drinking. It is common practice for laborers to celebrate their monthly receipt of wages by going out in large groups to feast and visit brothels. Solitary drinking is highly unusual given the connection of alcohol use and the manipulation of social relations. The marital and extramarital spheres are conceptualized, within this culture, as distinct arenas of sexual experience. Drinking and drunkenness serve as framing devices for men to make the transition from the structured, non-eroticized domestic sphere to the transgressive world of commercial sex and the affirmation of stereotypical masculinity it confers. Because of the link between alcohol consumption and commercial sex, as well as the high likelihood that drinkers either will refuse to use condoms or will use them incorrectly, social drinking in the northern Thailand context must be considered as a major risk factor for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."

With only 37% married women of reproductive age using contraception, unwanted pregnancy is a major public health problem that leads to 5-6 million abortions each year, with many procedures carried out in unhygienic conditions. India's maternal mortality rate is 1/50 (as compared to 1/2700 in developed countries), and children under age 5 years have a doubled chance of death if their mothers die. Also, in order to promote healthy birth spacing and delay first births in young mothers, the practice of prolonged breast-feeding must be encouraged while appropriate contraceptives to increase birth intervals are introduced and new methods are developed for lactating women. Another challenge is to increase the use of male methods and develop a vaccine for male fertility regulation. Unmet need for contraception exists among 80% of married women in India, and efforts should be made to understand and respond to barriers to contraceptive adoption. In light of the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS, it is also important to study sex behavior, especially among adolescents, in order to devise appropriate prevention policies and programs."

By June 1994, 1016 cases of AIDS had been reported and 1627 people had been identified as HIV-positive. 93% of those with AIDS were men; homosexual/bisexual transmission accounted for 66.2% of cases and heterosexual transmission another 19.4%. In-depth interviews with AIDS patients revealed they were a well-defined population subgroup with few linkages to other sectors. This finding calls into question the current government strategy of broad-based mass media campaigns. Preferable would be campaigns that target homosexual men. A strength of the Chilean primary health care system is its effective utilization of nurses. Nurses manage about 1/3 of clinic visits, with no input from physicians, and their involvement in AIDS prevention should be strengthened."

Ethnographic interviews were conducted with a subsample of subjects (10 Puerto Ricans, 20 Mexicans, and 20 Dominicans) to examine the cultural meaning of risk behaviors. Structured interviews based on the NIDA AIDS Initial Assessment were conducted with the subjects to describe demographic characteristics and summarize levels of risk behaviors. Qualitative data showed that for the Mexican women in El Paso poverty, violence, drug dealing and transport, tourist clients, and an environment of illegality were the realities more than for the Dominican and Puerto Rican prostitutes. The Dominican sample in New York City transported to their new environment strong family values and proscriptions against drug use as well as prostitution in brothels on account of poverty-related motivations for the support of their children. The Puerto Rican women reflected acculturation evolved in two locations, as well as illicit drugs, violence, and abuse. 92% of the Dominican women, 71% of the Mexican women, and only 25% of the Puerto Rican women were born in their native countries. Only 10% of the Puerto Ricans, 36% of the Mexicans, and 53% of the Dominicans always used condoms. 58% of the Puerto Ricans, 21% of the Mexicans, and 13% of the Dominicans reported ever having a sexually transmitted disease (p 0.001). Of those tested by the project, only 2% of the Mexicans vs. 8% of the Dominicans were HIV positive. Among drug-addicted Puerto Ricans, the HIV seroprevalence rate was 40-50%. 79% of the Puerto Rican prostitutes were sex partners of iv drug users.

Yet HIV seroprevalence rates in prostitutes in other sub=Saharan African countries can be as high as 90%. 5-10% of women of reproductive age in Kinshasa are HIV positive, but the HIV infection rate as stabilized. Health workers may not learn why this has occurred, however, since the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stopped providing personnel and funds to Zaire's AIDS Program (Project SIDA). It is the continent's largest and most reputable and significant effort to fight AIDS. Its Zairian researchers are international level scientists. Project SIDA had 8 sites which tracked HIV infection in prostitutes and treated tuberculosis in AIDS patients and sexually transmitted diseases since they foster the spread of HIV. It also carried on a successful education and condom distribution campaign. Other countries use Project SIDA as a model to control AIDS. The most obvious effect of CDC withdrawal will be the reduced services to prostitutes according to a US pathologist. The project can no longer follow about 2000 mothers and children infected with HIV. CDC's withdrawal also negates any planned clinical trials of an AIDS vaccine. CDC claims it is no longer supporting Project SIDA because the government of Zaire can no longer guarantee the safety of CDC employees after the looting spree of unpaid soldiers in September-October 1991. Tensions have grown since December 1991 when the President, who gained power in a US Central Intelligence Agency backed coup in 1960, did not relinquish power at the end of his 46th term.

However, surveys conducted in a range of countries have shown that mass media educational campaigns increase knowledge yet have a limited impact on behavior. Most effective are community-based initiatives that utilize existing networks and draw on local cultural traditions. For example, a Nairobi health education program in which prostitutes selected by their peers led group meetings where condoms were distributed led to increasing rates of condom use and a reduction in the risk of HIV infection. There is agreement that young people should receive education on the transmission of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) before they become sexually active and at risk, yet the age at which such education should begin and the content of the curriculum are controversial issues. It is further essential to recognize that about 40 million of the world's children do not attend school, and many are \"street kids\" who are forced into prostitution by economic necessity at an early age. Research, pretesting, and evaluation of any AIDS prevention campaigns are essential, especially under conditions of limited resources."

Considerable evidence shows that anti-prostitution laws facilitate violence and abuse against prostitutes and may increase their risk of contracting HIV/STDs. For example, police often take advantage of existing laws against prostitution to demand money or sex. In general, the strict enforcement of anti-prostitution laws marginalizes prostitutes from services which could help them avoid abuse and promotes an environment in which prostitutes must take risks to avoid detection and arrest. One strategy to improve prostitutes' lives would therefore be to remove laws which prevent them from working safely and from travelling abroad to work legally. Projects in which prostitutes are actively involved have helped break down stereotypes against prostitutes, while police-sex worker liaison projects in Scotland and Australia have led to higher levels of reporting of crimes against prostitutes. The Network of Sex Work Projects (NSWP), an organization which links sex worker health programs around the world, has found that the incidence of HIV/STDs among prostitutes is lowest when they have control over their work conditions; access to condoms, lubricants, and other safe sex materials; and respect of their basic human and legal rights. People need to understand that consensual involvement in sex work is different from forced sex trafficking."

The AIDS Prevention Bill subjects member of high-risk groups (prostitutes, drug addicts, and professional blood donors) to compulsory testing and segregation. Not only does this law infringe on human rights and privacy, its high cost and the amount of resources required make it impossible execute. Also, it is difficult to adequately classify the high-risk groups. While prostitutes in red light districts might be singled out, promiscuous behavior elsewhere goes unchecked. Furthermore, the coercive and stigmatizing elements of the bill end up driving AIDS-infected individual underground. Dhanda suggests a recasting of the bill into a noncoercive measure of legal regulation. Currently, informed responsible behavior is the best AIDS preventive strategy. But in order to make it possible for people to act responsibly, human rights need to be recognized. Therefore, the law should acknowledge this, allowing for confidential testing, informed consent, and protection against discrimination. The law can also take the form of regulatory measures such as those used to prevent the adulteration of food and drugs. This regulations should aim at ensuring that blood supplied are not infected and that manufacturers and dealers in blood follow are held liable for unsafe products. Instead of stigmatizing groups of individuals, the law should require the modification of unsafe practices."

The Criminal Law Amendment Act would make it so that boys under age 12 cannot be charged or convicted of a sex crime; anyone, except in the case of married couples, intentionally infecting someone with HIV will be liable to a prison sentence not exceeding 15 years; a person convicted of rape, having sex with a girl under age 16 years, or having sex with an imbecile while being HIV-positive will be sentenced to prison for no more than 20 years, regardless of whether the person was aware he or she was infected; and all people charged with sex offenses will be tested for infection with HIV. The South African AIDS Legal Network opposes legislation which criminalizes the transmission of HIV. Such legislation will not help check the spread of HIV. Furthermore, criminalizing the transmission of HIV will discourage people from seeking education, counseling, and treatment, further stigmatizing HIV and AIDS, dividing communities and households, and violating basic human rights.

With female prostitutes and their clients the primary targets, efforts are being made to raise overall awareness in the country and to train trainers to carry out prevention activities. Strategies being used include the translation into Vietnamese and country-wide distribution of a book about AIDS, the establishment of a sexually transmitted diseases clinic in a poor district of Ho Chi Minh City, street theater presentations, condom distribution, circulation of a variety of educational material, a peer counseling program, and the establishment of a revolving loan fund to help prostitutes find other ways to support themselves."

        "title": "The AIDS epidemic: implications for the sexuality education of our youth.",
        "abstract": "Even though more schools, community organizations, and national agencies encourage sex education in light of the AIDS epidemic than ever before, the majority of AIDS education programs for our youth are inadequate. For example, the staff of the Centers for Disease Control reviewed published curricula and learned that 2/3 of curricula only had 1-hour or 1-class session devoted to AIDS. Additionally, many such programs just reach middle class youth and those programs are limited to only teaching the biomedical aspects of AIDS, and ignore behavioral change through effective educational methodologies. In order to be effective AIDS education must be integrated into comprehensive health or sex education programs at each grade level, thereby reducing risk by continuous repetition of messages about AIDS. AIDS education programs must also address misinformation about HIV transmission so that fears associated with AIDS will diminish. This should be designed to lead youth towards compassion for people with HIV and/or AIDS. Effective programs must not accentuate the \"dangers of sex\" by simply advocating sexual abstinence, but help youth identify and resist social and peer pressure that encourages early sexual intercourse. There exists a wide range of sexual experiences in our youth, therefore AIDS prevention programs need to emphasize to the sexually active the urgency of using condoms each and every time one has intercourse. Another important component of such programs includes emphasizing that using alcohol and drugs impairs youth's ability to make sound decisions and that intravenous drugs increase the chances of contracting HIV, especially if needles are shared."

        "title": "Learning through experience.",
        "abstract": "After the first AIDS patients were diagnosed in 1983 in Trinidad and Tobago, every nurse attended a large group lecture on HIV/AIDS which lasted 1 or 2 days. Even though the information acquired helped them greatly in infection control, the lectures did not prepare them adequately for caring for AIDS patients. The nurses did not want to treat AIDS patients and would not make home visits. They feared infection with HIV and stigmatization through their contact with AIDS patients. They often believed God was punishing AIDS patients. They were intolerant of homosexual men and were more willing to care for HIV/AIDS patients who were children or infected by a blood transfusion. In 1990, these attitudes and beliefs prompted a modification of the design of the training program. The program now involves all participants and uses role playing to simulate reality. Each training course has only 10-15 people and is informal and relaxed. It is held 1 day a week for 8 weeks. The subject matter depends on participants' needs identified through a questionnaire they complete before the course. Group discussions often include HIV positive people, family members, and experienced nurses. The nurses leave the course with a better understanding of the feelings and needs of people with AIDS, human sexuality, and the diversity of sexual behaviors. They are also better able to separate illness from sexual practice, recognize the value of each patient, communicate with and encourage families to accept the patient, support the patient, spread the word about prevention of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, and understand issues of HIV-positive homosexual and bisexual men. The primary health care system in Trinidad and Tobago serves HIV/AIDS patients. The nurses visit them in their homes and make sure they receive the care they need at hospitals and outpatient clinics."

        "title": "The hormonal ring: a new contraceptive gains acceptance.",
        "abstract": "The Population Council's International Committee on Contraceptive Research has been working on an alternative hormonal contraceptive in the form of a vaginal contraceptive ring. The ring is 58 mm in diameter and consists of a core of Silastic covered by a thin layer of levonorgestrel and estradiol and an overcoat of silicone rubber. The ring is inserted into the vagina on the 5th day of the menstrual cycle and withdrawn 3 weeks later for 1 week. The contraceptive steroids are released from the Silastic at a regular rate and readily absorbed through the vagina. Thus, the blood levels of contraceptive hormones reached during the use of the ring are sufficient to prevent ovulation but do not exhibit the great daily variations commonly observed in women on oral contraceptives (OCs). There are sufficient hormones in the ring to provide 6 months of contraception. Preliminary research on Swedish and other developed country women indicates that the ring is as effective as, and safer than, OCs. The International Development REsearch Center supported a study to determine the ring's acceptability in practice. It was carried out by the National Council on Population and the Family, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and the Centre for Research on Maternal and Child Health, Campinas, Brazil. The ring was offered, along with other methods, in a number of clinics in each country where prescriptions, instruction, and follow-up were the responsibility of paramedical personnel. The study involved an observation period during which 150-200 ring acceptors in each country were to be enrolled and matched with OC users. Findings indicated that ring users were slightly older than OC acceptors and that they and their partners tended to have more education. 10% of ring users complained of difficulty associated with insertion, 20% of difficulty with removal. 43% worried about correct placement. Twice as many ring users reported menstrual problems, but a larger percentage of OC users (26%) than ring users (17%) reported having other problems, such as headaches. Regarding satisfaction with the method, a larger percentage of the ring users (17%) considered their experience \"very good,\" but the general level of satisfaction with both methods was similar. The information obtained from the study provides important data for the final design of the new method and the instructions that will accompany it."

        "abstract": "The World AIDS Foundation funded a US team of educators and researchers to go to India to train health care workers, ranging from physicians to counselors of nongovernmental organizations, in HIV/AIDS education. The workshops were conducted in Ajmer, Rajasthan; Indore, Madhya Pradesh; and Aizawl, Mizoram. More than 200 health care workers attended two mini-symposia at Jodhpur and Bombay (Wadia Hospital). The local and national newspapers, the All India Radio, and national television extensively covered the training program. Each person attending the workshops is to train 10 other people. At the end of 12 months, there should be at least 2000 people educated in HIV/AIDS prevention and control. Local physicians served as faculty at each site. The Secretary General of the Indian Health Organization (IHO), an HIV/AIDS specialist, joined the US team and served as a faculty member for the workshops in Ajmer and Indore and at the mini-symposium in Jodhpur. Other participants in the Indore workshop were two famous Indian actors, one of whom became a politician. The IHO leader is working to reduce the HIV infection rate among commercial sex workers, which has increased from 0.5% to 60% between 1986 and 1993. By the year 2000, there will be 30-50 million HIV infected people in India, with 10,000 of them dying daily, resulting in 20,000 AIDS orphans/day. Obstacles to adequately addressing HIV/AIDS in India include fear and ignorance of AIDS, insufficient knowledge among health workers as well as among the public, fear of health workers to treat HIV/AIDS patients, lack of policies protecting patients' rights, lack of good pre- or post-testing counseling in many states, no HIV/AIDS support groups, no hotlines, no resources, denial, and inadequate blood safety. The US team intends to follow-up participants by communicating with and supporting them."

        "abstract": "Although sex workers are often willing to utilize healthy sex practices, male clients should be made more aware of AIDS prevention and safe sex practices. Men have many misconceptions about safe sex methods. These misconceptions include believing that condoms reduce sexual pleasure; post-intercourse washing prevents infection; HIV transmission is not possible through anal or oral intercourse; and safe sex is associated with expensive sex. To improve their knowledge about safe sexual practices and to enhance their willingness to employ safe sex measures, sex education should be directed toward males who buy sex. To change the attitudes of male clients, programs should determine if these clients are local men or visitors. Information could then be supplied through local media which would reach male residents or through hotels or customs which are accessible to male visitors. Since sex workers often meet their clients in bars or hotels, AIDS information and condoms could be distributed from these locations. To change sex behaviors, programs must investigate current sexual practices to identify practices that are at less risk for AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. Preventive information could also be supplied by the sex workers. Furthermore, low-cost condoms should be available to male clients and sex workers."

        "abstract": "Since HIV/AIDS was first recorded in Papua New Guinea in 1987, the number of cases has grown considerably. It is estimated that 16 new infections for every 100,000 people are reported annually. It has the highest rate of HIV/AIDS transmission in the Pacific region, and with the rapid spread of the disease, the future development of the country is seriously threatened. This highlights the fact that AIDS is more than just a health issue, rather, it is a disease that potentially poses major challenges to the economic and social base of the nation. This paper considers four key sociocultural and economic factors in the spread of HIV in Papua New Guinea. These include 1) contemporary sexual culture; 2) the position of women in society; 3) migration; and 4) health services. Overall, lack of development, poverty, low educational levels, inadequate and declining health services, poor nutrition and health status of the population, and growing inequalities between rural and urban areas create the conditions for rapid transmission of the epidemic. In view of such fragile economic and political infrastructure of Papua New Guinea, AIDS is undoubtedly a major development issue that has both human and economic impacts."

        "abstract": "More than 700,000 people are thought to be HIV positive in Thailand. A booming sex industry and social attitudes which support the male patronage of prostitutes are major factors in the spread of disease in the country. A 4-day workshop on sexual behavior and AIDS in Thailand was attended by representatives from Burma, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. According to the Joint UN Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the percentage of military conscripts in northern Thailand who visited a brothel in the past year fell from 58% in 1991 to 23% in 1995, while the percentage of recruits using condoms during their most recent brothel visits increased from 60% to 90% over the same period. Statistics from the Thai Public Health Ministry indicate that the percentage of men in the general population who used condoms when visiting a brothel increased from 40% in 1990 to 90% in 1994. Furthermore, a nationwide survey among military conscripts found the prevalence of HIV infection fell from 3.7% in 1993 to 2.5% in 1995, with the downward trend continuing in 1996. This success in reducing the level of sexual risk behavior and the incidence of HIV infection in Thailand lends hope for the possibility of changing the course of the HIV/AIDS epidemic elsewhere."

        "title": "Breaking the chain: STDs and HIV.",
        "abstract": "Prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) is a major challenge particularly in developing countries. The chance of HIV transmission during a single act of intercourse may be increased 50 times. This article discusses the relationship between STDs and HIV transmission and identification of some of the problems involved in treatment, vertical and horizontal integration of health-seeking behavior, and the costs and motivation to halt the spread of STDs and HIV. Special inserts describe the operation of Chicago's Municipal STD Clinic and the typical daily waiting room experiences, and selected commentary on STD treatment in Zambia and Zimbabwe which reveals the interference of one's personal sense of shame and stigma in the treatment process. Estimates of 200 million cases of gonorrhea and 50 million cases of syphilis worldwide are really guestimates since in many countries STDs go unreported, untreated, and unrecognized. The presence of genital sores or even inflammation as in the case of chlamydia is thought to be critical in the transmission of HIV. Sexual behavior changes are needed. The VII Regional Conference of the African Union Against Venereal Diseases, 1991, suggested HIV prevention must concentrate on promoting safer sex, increasing the availability of condoms, and early diagnosis and treatment of STDs. Identifications of STDs can be difficult; many people seek treatment outside the formal health care system. There is a concentration of HIV in areas with high STD rates. In Zambia's University Teaching Hospital in 1991, 54% of all STD patients and 60% of STD patients in an urban health center in Kariba, Zimbabwe, were positive for HIV. 33% of STD clinic patients in Bombay, India, were HIV positive. STD control and prevention could bring about better control of HIV. There also can be pooling of resources and targeting at-risk populations. The transmission chain can be broken with appropriate notification of partners and coordination at the ministerial level between AID and STD programs. Several models of STD control are indicated: vertical as in specialized clinics and horizontal as in regular health care settings. In Sweden, STDs have almost been eliminated due to youth clinic services. Developing countries with an investment of $US10 or less in health care need outside funding for STD programs. Money and innovative strategies are needed but also practical technology for diagnosis and new drugs that are simple, safe, and affordable."

        "abstract": "The results of a Gambian study may explain how 30 women out of 424 prostitutes in Nairobi, Kenya, remain uninfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) after 5-6 years of prostitution, in spite of a prevalence rate of 90% in city sex workers. The Gambian study also found a group of uninfected sex workers who had been repeatedly exposed to the virus; researchers believe killer T-cells are responsible. Sarah Rowland-Jones of the Institute of Molecular Medicine at the University of Oxford, at the Medical Research Council's clinic in Fajara, Gambia, studied 6 female sex workers who had been prostitutes for more than 5 years and rarely practiced safe sex. Approximately 30% of sex workers in the region are infected with HIV; this suggests that the workers were exposed to the virus once or twice per month over 5 years. 3 of the women had high levels of killer T-cells; 2 had some level. Killer T-cells, or cytotoxic lymphocytes, seek out and destroy virus-infected cells; they are particularly effective against viruses (like HIV) which are passed cell to cell without passing through the bloodstream where they would be attacked by antibody. Although they are found in people with HIV, in most cases they are overwhelmed by the virus. One hypothesis in these uninfected cases is that the women were first infected with HIV-2, a less aggressive strain dominant in West Africa; built up an immunity to it; and then fought off the infection with HIV-1 that arrived later in Gambia. Rowland-Jones will next determine the levels of killer T-cells in the uninfected Nairobi sex workers; her results should be available in April 1995."

        "abstract": "Studies that have noted higher incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in IUD users have never suggested that IUDs are unsafe for all women and thus should be available to none. The available research shows that IUD users who have only 1 sexual partner and are that person's only partner are at no greater risk of contracting PID than women practicing other methods or no method of contraception. Women with more than 1 sexual partner appear to be at a significantly higher risk of PID, suggesting a link between PID and a sexual lifestyle which increases the risk of exposure to sexually transmitted diseases. Age and parity also are significant variables, with younger nulliparous IUD users more at risk of PID. Studies need to measure IUD users' exposure to sexually transmitted diseases in order to establish accurate causal links with PID. A major limitation of the World Health Organization (WHO) sponsored research in Thailand, India, Nigeria, the Philippines, Chile, and South Korea -- 1 of the few large studies of the relationship between IUD use and PID undertaken in developing countries -- was its lack of information about participants' sexual histories and number of sexual partners, an indicator of increased risk of sexually transmitted disease. In many cultures, such information may be difficult to obtain, but without it it is not possible to sort out the different roles in PID of sexual activity, sexually transmitted diseases, and IUD use. According to Dr. Judith Fortney of Family Health International (FHI), the current research picture suggests that in the US large numbers of women for whom the IUD is ideal are deprived of this contraceptive method. She suggests that the IUD should be prescribed for women in mutually monogamous relationships rather than taking IUDs off the market. The US Food and Drug Administration continues to approve IUDs. Safety claims against the IUDs most recently withdrawn from US sales have been repeatedly rejected by the courts. International observers need to appreciate that American marketing decisions in the field of family planning often are controlled by nonclinical considerations. In the US, the high cost of meeting unwarranted legal action forced manufacturers of the IUD to withdraw their product from sale."

A gay activist and founder of the Fraternity for AIDS Cessation in Thailand (FACT) informs bar patrons and the homosexual community in Thailand on AIDS and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 5 brightly dressed male dancers perform with this activist whose name is Natee Teerarojanapong. They visit gay bars and bath houses in Bangkok and will now go to the provinces. The Thai government realizes the seriousness of the AIDS problem. Recently it began a 3-year program and set up an AIDS Prevention and Control Center headed by the Ministry of Public Health. It has started an intensive information campaign. Plans to distribute 30 million condoms are underway. This year's AIDS budget has been increased. The government has called upon nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector to help. With FACT, groups like Empower, a sister organization of prostitutes, the Duang Prateep Foundation of the Klong Toey slums, Population and Development Association (PDA), the Red Cross and Planned Parenthood Association of Thailand (PPAT) have begun their own AIDS prevention and control programs. Public Health Ministry officials say only 18 persons are showing full-blown AIDS symptoms. But, more than 7500 tested positive for HIV antibodies. 84% of current seropositives are intravenous drug users; there are an estimated 500,000 heroin addicts in Thailand. The main activities of the AIDS programs has been concerned with heroin addiction. 400,000 of the 1/2 million heroin addicts are in Bangkok. In Klong Toey, the biggest slum area in Bangkok, the AIDS problem is compounded by extreme poverty. The Thai Red Cross is very active in the AIDS program. Officials at Bangkok's Klong Prem prison are being trained by PPAT. They are taught about AIDS control and prevention. Among the 400 prison inmates, those infected with AIDS are mostly intravenous drug users; some have contacted AIDS through homosexual transmission. A random survey of prostitutes in 14 provinces showed some 3000 prostitutes tested positive for HIV."

        "abstract": "The author presents arguments to refute what he considers alarmist, unsupported generalizations about the origin and soread of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) in Africa. The first myth is that AIDS originated in Africa, after a green monkey bit a man. There is no concrete evidence to support this theory. Moreover, if it were true, AIDS would have been known for years; there would be effective herbal remedies and folk traditions about the danger of green monkey bites. The syndrome is so distinctive, for example the oral candidiasis and striking wasting disease, called \"slim\" disease, that it would have been recognized long ago. Finally, numbers of cases have peaked in America first, a few years ago, and are now beginning to surge in some areas of Africa. A second myth is that countries are not reporting cases out of embarrassment. The author claims that reports to the WHO show far more cases of AIDS in the U.S. and Europe, and even if the 1000 cases in Africa as of 1986 were 1000-fold underestimated, they would be nowhere near the 5 or 10 million often printed. The third myth, that AIDS is out of control in Africa, is unsupported when the efforts of countries like Uganda are considered. Uganda has an extensive media campaign, significant funds relegated to fighting AIDS, foreign experts called in, blood testing equipment on order and in use in 2 hospitals. AIDS is only a problem in a few urban areas."

The Church's influence upon the government, however, has decreased over the years such that government pamphlets now carry specific, graphic instructions on how to use condoms. This realistic approach to prevention taken by the government has been implemented even though the Church still refuses to endorse condom use and avoids mentioning them in the context of AIDS prevention. Even though the Catholic Church tries to deny that people, young and old alike, have sex solely for pleasure outside of the confines of heterosexual, marital relationships, it must increasingly face reality even within its own ranks. Even though only one priest has thus far openly declared his HIV status, at least 25 of the 1410 priests in Sao Paolo are thought to have died of AIDS in the last five years, while a senior source in the Church believes that more than 40 priests out of a total 14,000 could be seriously ill; no one knows how many are asymptomatically HIV-seropositive. It is clear that HIV cases identified and suspected thus far among the clergy were the result of sexual activity. In this context, the Church has become less verbally opposed to AIDS prevention campaigns, provides care for the sick without moral condemnation, and tends to support its HIV-seropositive priests."

Over 250,000 cases of AIDS had been reported to WHO from over 150 countries by mid-1990. Because of under-reporting WHO estimates that actually 700,000 cases of AIDS exist. WHO predicts 1 million cases by 2000. 6-8 million persons with HIV are estimated, and 15-20 million are predicted for 2000, depending on the rate of increase in Asia and Latin America. Heterosexual transmission accounts for about 60% cases, increasing rapidly, especially in urban areas. 75-80% of cases in 2000 will have been heterosexually transmitted. Developing countries have 2/3 of current HIV infections, expected to be 75-80% in 2000. It is thought that 1 out of 20 adults in sub-Saharan Africa is HIV+. Among men, the ratio is 1 out of 75 in North America, 1 in 125 in South America, 1 in 200 in Western Europe. Among women, the ratio is 1 in 700 in North America, 1 in 500 in South America, 1 in 700 in Western Europe and 1 in 20,000 women in Eastern Europe.

        "abstract": "HIV infections are spreading rapidly among women in China. Women are viewed as more susceptible to HIV infections due to their social status and other characteristics. The physical attributes that increase transmission to women are the open genital configuration and the higher density of HIV infection in men's semen. Women are also more likely to be recipients of blood transfusions because of hemorrhage and anemia during pregnancy and childbirth. Increases in transmission in China are due to prostitution. The lack of symptoms among HIV carriers means sex partners do not know. Prostitutes are not aware generally about their male partners' high risk behavior, such as drug use or HIV infection. Illiteracy is a major reason for lack of information about HIV infections among prostitutes. Women may request condom use, but men may refuse. Premarital sex and having multiple partners increases the risk of transmission. The only effective measure for preventing the spread of AIDS is a health education campaign and improved education. The World Health Organization (WHO) is engaged in a global effort to improve women's status in their social, economic, and political lives. WHO declared a readiness to work with women's groups in preventing AIDS and to provide information to groups and individuals about the danger of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. A study in 1993 revealed that only 34.8% of prostitutes in Beijing, Dalian, Nanjing, and Xian were aware that condoms could protect against HIV infections. 45% never used condoms. 71.1% viewed condoms as useful contraceptives and only secondarily as protection against sexually transmitted diseases or AIDS. Almost 39% of prostitutes' partners agreed to use condoms. 8% agreed only with a decrease in the price of services. 48.2% refused. 68% believed themselves to be at little risk of contracting HIV. WHO estimated that 1 million women became infected with HIV in 1993. Almost 50% of new adult HIV carriers are women. By the year 2000, 13 million women will be HIV infected, and about 4 million women will have died of AIDS. 18.5 million people are currently infected worldwide, and 4.5 million people have AIDS.

Research suggests that men aged 18-25 years rarely use condoms, and only 7.1% of currently married women in India aged 13-49 years report ever having used condoms for contraception. 1628 HIV-negative men were recruited to participate in a follow-up study evaluating the sex behavioral impact of repeated HIV counseling and testing. At the first and all subsequent visits, the men gave blood samples, received physical examinations, and answered questions on demographics, previous STDs, medical history, sex behavior, and knowledge of HIV and AIDS. Participants also received one-on-one counseling with a trained social worker. At 3-month intervals, the men were offered condoms, underwent clinical and behavioral exams, and counseled to remain monogamous and use condoms. Almost one-third of participants had never heard of AIDS at their initial screening visit. However, with each return visit, the level of consistent condom use increased. At 6 months, men were 2.8 times more likely to consistently use condoms with prostitutes; 3.6 times at 18 months, and 4.7 times at 24 months. Over the course of the study, the number of men who reported having sex with a prostitute fell from 63% to 16% by 6 months, then rose to 23% by 24 months of follow-up. Low education levels and ignorance of how HIV is transmitted were consistently associated with continued visits to prostitutes and a lack of condom use."

        "abstract": "The numbers of AIDS cases and HIV infections detected in the Philippines have risen slowly but steadily since the first AIDS case in the country was diagnosed in 1984. By the end of 1995, 234 AIDS cases and 470 HIV infections had been reported to the country's Department of Health. However, given the limited extent to which people have been tested for HIV infection, there are most likely many more cases than reported. The HIV/AIDS epidemic is spreading within the Filipino population. The country's substantial commercial sex trade, reports suggesting that many unmarried young men have sexual intercourse with girlfriends and acquaintances, and IV drug use among a small number of young people are factors which contribute to the potential for a serious HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Philippines. Findings from the 1994 national Young Adult Fertility and Sexuality Study, a household survey covering 10,879 men and women aged 15-24 years in 959 different communities, are presented. Almost all respondents had heard of AIDS, but there was some degree of ignorance and misinformation on the modes of HIV transmission. 13% of all single men reported having had only one sex partner, 10% reported two or more partners, and 3% reported five or more. 98% of sexually active men had heard of condoms, 58% knew that condom use can protect against HIV infection, 23% reported ever having used one, and 4% reported using a condom during the most recent act of sexual intercourse."

        "abstract": "Analyzing why the rate of transmission of AIDS varies widely in Africa is the basis for designing strategies for intervention. Promiscuity, i.e. high rates of sex partner change, is not the only reason for rapid transmission, but it is a prerequisite for the explosive spread seen in certain groups. High frequency groups include mobile single men and prostitutes. Research and strategies must focus on sex practices, concepts of personal vulnerability, and possibility of behavioral change. The sexually transmitted diseases that are thought to increase susceptibility to HIV, i.e., genital ulcer diseases, can be controlled with appropriate strategies. Male circumcision is associated with lower HIV seroprevalence. Thus strategies must be concentrate on sustained prevention among high STD transmitters, providing early, effective care for STDs, increasing economic alternatives for women, and offering voluntary circumcision where culturally acceptable."

        "abstract": "It has been suggested that the penal system creates an environment in which sexuality is used both to assert control over others and to react against depression and frustration. Due to the tendency of closed institutions to vest power and decision-making in the upper-level hierarchy, institutional authorities are often reluctant to place the design, control, and implementation of AIDS intervention programs in the hands of juvenile inmates. A study investigated the sexual behavior and AIDS-related knowledge of pupils at an Industrial School for Boys in Cape Town, South Africa. Questionnaires were administered to 259 boys aged 13-21 years during normal school hours and in the absence of school officials. The pupils were first taught how to indicate their choice of answer during a practice session and then the questions and possible alternative questions were read to them in groups of 30. Findings revealed that the pupils generally lacked accurate knowledge about HIV/AIDS, although 93% knew that sexual intercourse can result in HIV transmission. Different strategies should be formulated to adequately address the issues of AIDS and juvenile delinquency. It must also be recognized that children who have the opportunity to develop within an environment fostering healthy self-concepts and strong social skills are less vulnerable to both juvenile delinquency and HIV infection."

        "abstract": "The HIV/AIDS epidemic necessitated promotion of condoms. By the late 1980s condom use had surpassed use of all other contraceptive methods, including oral contraceptives, in the UK. The change from use of a medical contraceptive method to use of a readily available nonmedical method occurred at the same time family practitioners surpassed community family planning centers as contraceptive providers. During the 1980s the rate of women attending family planning clinics fell (15% to 10%, 1980-1990) and condom use among the women who did attend these clinics increased (10% to about 16%). At the same time the number of unwanted pregnancies in England and Wales, as reflected in the legal abortion rate (10% to 13%), rose, especially after the mid-1980s. Two studies indicate that unwanted pregnancies are most common in the youngest women using condoms. After young women with an unwanted pregnancy due to condom failure undergo abortion, they tend not to use condoms. The condom promotion campaign in the UK asserted that the condom was an acceptable contraceptive method as well as a means to protect against sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV infection, which led many women to discontinue the more effective contraceptives and to use only condoms. The campaign should have emphasized condom use along with simultaneous use of an effective contraceptive, such as the birth control pill. This combination (Double Dutch method) is acceptable in other countries, for example, in Holland. Increased use of the Double Dutch method should reduce unwanted pregnancies."

On overnight trips, she has witnessed young women coming to the boats for money, food, and fun. Sometimes the young women expect payment for sex, other times sex is considered just part of the fun. The behavior that the fisheries officer has witnessed led her to participate in a workshop on prevention of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the hope of becoming usefully involved herself and of involving her department in the process of health planning. The second account is of a young boy living on the streets who survives on money gained from sailors and prostitutes for arranging sexual liaisons, from begging, and from stealing. During a workshop for young people on sexual behavior, the 13-year-old boy reported that he has unprotected sex with his girlfriend but that the girls who go to the boats carry condoms with them. The final account is about a nun who works in a very poor area of Honiara and has helped the community build a simple chapel, which has become the focal point of the community. This nun has also counseled families and persuaded some to take their children who had been living on the streets back home."

This survey, conducted in August 1987-April 1988 in 35 countries, measured the level of awareness of AIDS, the extent of concern about AIDS, knowledge, changes in behavior resulting form the AIDS epidemic, and attitudes toward people with AIDS. Overall, the poll's findings attest to the effectiveness of the health education efforts of governmental and nongovernmental organizations. Awareness that AIDS poses an urgent international health problem was almost universal in the 35 samples. In about half of these countries, AIDS was identified as the most important national health problem; in the remaining countries, AIDS was ranked 2nd to cancer. The proportion of respondents expressing a fear of personally contracting the AIDS virus ranged from lows of under 10% in most of Europe to a high of 45% among South African blacks. A majority of respondents in the US, Colombia, the Philippines, Brazil, Nigeria, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Chile believed that AIDS will soon spread beyond current risk groups to the general population. Despite widespread awareness of the grave threat posed by AIDS, insufficient numbers of respondents reported that they had made specific behavioral changes intended to protect themselves form HIV infection. Overall, about half of those interviewed indicated they are now more cautious in their choice of sexual partners; similarly, about half are using condoms more or for the 1st time."

        "abstract": "While barrier methods such as condoms and spermicides appear to offer protection against the AIDS virus, further research is needed. Other than abstinence, monogamy, and the curtailment of sexual activities with multiple partners, barrier methods seem to be the only protection against AIDS. Studies have shown that HIV cannot pass through latex or synthetic skin condoms, and that HIV is killed by exposure to spermicidally treated condoms. Studies also indicate that condoms protect against bacterial STDs such as gonorrhea, mycoplasma, and hospitalized pelvic inflammatory disease. A study in the US followed 24 uninfected sexual partners of AIDS patients for 12-36 months. Only 1 partner among the 10 couples who used condoms contracted HIV, but 12 partners among the 14 couples who did not used condoms became infected. A study in Zaire revealed that prostitutes whose clients often used condoms reported much lower rates of infection than women whose clients rarely used condoms. Furthermore, laboratory studies indicate that spermicides such as nonoxynol-9 are effective against a variety of STDs, including HIV. A study conducted in Thailand found that the use of vaginal sponges impregnated with nonoxynol-9 significantly reduced the rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea among prostitutes. But just as condoms and spermicides do not completely eliminate the risk of pregnancy, neither can they be expected to offer complete protection against HIV. Moreover, these methods must be used regardless of other contraceptive practices. The article concludes by pointing out the need for further research into the acceptability and effectiveness of different barrier methods."

There was an 8-fold increase (from 30,000 to 250,000) in Asia during in the same period. 16 million persons are estimated to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide; 10 million are in sub-Saharan Africa. A shorter incubation period is suspected in Africa, which means that most persons there who are now infected will have developed AIDS by the year 2000. The infection rate during 1994 and 1995 is estimated to be 6000 per day. The rate of infection in South and Southeast Asia is accelerating at a rate similar to that in sub-Saharan Africa in the 1980s. 40% of the 12 million infected adults today are women, an increase from 25% in 1990. Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death in HIV positive adults in Africa. Infection among prostitutes in Bombay, India rose from 1% to 40% in 7 years. If the present rate of infection continues, the cost of AIDS in Asia will be $ 38-52 billion dollars by the year 2000."

Fear messages should only be used if they are posed at a level that motivates and empowers people to take positive action, not so high that the inspire denial or coercive actions. If fear based messages are used, they must include recommended protective behaviors. Alternatively, the positive consequences of engaging in the healthy behavior should be emphasized, and the altruistic results of responsible behavior should be stated. Since people are more likely to try behaviors if they feel capable, teach the desired skills. Good ways to teach new skills are to allow for planning and rehearsal, to show examples e.g. by video, to encourage the substitute behavior explicitly. People are more likely to adopt new behavior if they have choices of alternatives. Examples are ways to perceive condoms as pleasurable and popular, use of other modes of sexual expression besides intercourse. Campaigns are more successful if they are conducted in an environment conducive to change, if influential people are seen adopting the change, and if resumption after relapse and maintenance of the behavior are encouraged."

An age-matched, oral pill-using sample from the Edmonton Birth Control Center was surveyed for comparison. 56% of the survey respondents in both clinics were teens and 39% were age 20-24 years. 89% of Calgary clients and 45% of Edmonton clients reported having received condoms from their respective clinics. The Edmonton clinic offered no free condom distribution program during the pre-survey period. 72% of Calgary clients had either used the free condoms or gave them to other people. 39% of Calgary clinic respondents reported using both condom and pill at last intercourse compared to 29% of Edmonton respondents, a nonstatistically significant difference. A larger and better controlled cost-benefit analysis of free condom distribution programs is warranted given the importance of condom use for STD prevention among users of oral contraception."

In the Philippines, heterosexual transmission of AIDS still accounts for the most common route of transmission. The Department of Social Work and Development brought street prostitutes both female and male aged 12-14 years old to the SERRA Institute for Girls in Maricaban and a shelter house for boys in Pasay. Here, they were given the choice to either stay at the shelters or return to their homes.

While long-distance tourism was long enjoyed by members of more privileged social classes, even the lower economical classes of Japan, Malaysia, Europe, America, and Australia can now afford to travel over long distances. This relatively new breed of tourist is more likely to be of lower socioeconomic and educational status and less likely to use condoms when having sex. An estimated 30,000 sex workers are active in Bangkok, of whom 7000/10,000 are females who work specifically in the tourism sector. 1/2-1/3 of the 600 commercial sex establishments in the city are visited by foreigners. Phuket, Pattaya, Koh Samui, and Chiangmai are also well-frequented by sex tourists. Overall, a large, diverse, inexpensive, and accessible commercial sex market exists in Thailand. One may meet sex workers quasi-ubiquitously and be assured to find someone capable of meeting one's sexual needs. With these attributes, Thailand strongly attracts tourists in search of sex. A certain degree of recklessness also prevails among those on vacation. Away from the peers and social mores of their native lands, tourists may engage in sexually activities without criticism. Likewise, Thai sex workers who cater to foreigners, especially females, enjoy more freedom and control in sexual relations than their peers who work among nationals. Neither single nor married women in Thailand are allowed much sexual freedom and are traditionally expected to be obliging docile, and submissive. The greater than normal personal latitude enjoyed by both sex worker and foreigner lead to more negotiation on condom use and overall lower use. As such, Thailand's commercial sex market with foreigners' involvement therein threatens to spread HIV to many other countries throughout the world."

        "abstract": "Focusing on increased vulnerability to HIV infection, this article examines some of the contexts within which these risk-taking behaviors occur and illustrates that the risk of contracting the disease is just one of the many risks with which Tanzanian youths are confronted. The sexual and substance use behaviors, and the relationship between such behaviors and economic factors, are discussed. Where evidences exist, attempts are made to compare the prevalence of these behaviors among male and female youths, as well as urban and rural youths. The extent to which males and females engage in risk-taking behaviors is unknown; however, studies show that, depending on age and gender, between 17% and 61% of youths are sexually active. Rates in HIV transmission vary by gender and by whether the youths are rural or urban inhabitants. Factors like adverse socioeconomic conditions, unemployment, lack of parental guidance and supervision, and culture all influence sexual risk-taking behaviors among youths. Meanwhile, increasing use of drugs and alcohol among the young population has been closely linked to increased vulnerability to unprotected sexual intercourse. Again, survival needs play a major role in sustaining risk behaviors. The paper concludes by outlining policy implications of youth risk behaviors, taking into account a multisectoral approach in dealing with the problem."

Extensive media coverage ensued and led to Bishop Albert Rouet, the bishop of Poitiers and chairman of the French Bishops' Conference, being interviewed by the Holy See's official radio. In the interview, Bishop Rouet distanced the Roman Catholic Church in France from the report, claiming that the media had exaggerated the issue and that his commission was not bound by the reference. The Vatican remains staunchly opposed to condom use against HIV infection and preaches abstinence outside of marriage and fidelity within marriage as the only true ways to avoid HIV infection. In 1995, the Vatican fired Jacques Gaillot, the former bishop of Evreux in Normandy, for his outspoken endorsement of condom use against HIV."

Usually each truck has a staff of 3, comprising 1 senior driver, 1 junior driver, and a cleaner, usually a child or an adolescent. 210 such adolescent truck cleaners were surveyed by random sampling of the parked trucks present in the transport nagar. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to these adolescents using the oral interview technique. The age distribution of the adolescents indicated that 17 were 15-16 years old, 63 were 16-17, 61 were 17-18, and 69 were 18-19. When the income was low, the owners or the senior drivers provided the meals and minor expenses. 80% of the adolescents were illiterate, 10.5% were literate, 6.2% had primary education, and 3.3% had middle school education. 88.1% of the cleaners were away from home for 24-28 days a month, 7.1% for less than 24 days, and 4.8% for over 28 days. 25.2% of the cleaners had a history of sexual activity, commonly with prostitutes. 88.6% of the senior drivers regularly visited prostitutes, and in many cases the adolescents' payment to the prostitute was financed by the senior driver. 94.3% of these adolescents had engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse, and the remaining 5.7% had used condoms infrequently. 98.5% of them had not heard of HIV and AIDS. 4.3% had a history of sexually transmitted diseases and had been treated by general practitioners. Substance abuse was fairly common among these young people (140 smoked, 9 chewed tobacco, 2 used opium, and 2 used alcohol more than twice per week), and the cost for those substances was primarily met by the senior truck driver or the owner. The trend was similar for sexual activity, as 25.2% had engaged in sex (12.9% once, 7.1% twice, and 5.2% several times). Special programs are required for these adolescents to educate them about the risks of unprotected sex and drugs in order to prevent them from contracting HIV/AIDS."

There is no risk of HIV transmission through sexual intercourse without condoms between sex partners who have been mutually monogamous for at least the past ten years, who have not shared unsterilized injectable drug paraphernalia with others, and who have not had a blood transfusion before 1987. Sexual intercourse without a condom under other circumstances may hold the risk of infecting or being infected with HIV. Many sexually active people lead healthy, fruitful lives in which they have sex with multiple partners and outside of the bounds of marriage. People who argue against condom use on religious or moral grounds are uninformed, ignorant, and simply wrong. Correct and consistent condom use can prevent the transmission of HIV and save lives. Even though they may occasionally fail, condoms tend to be reliable and effective in preventing the transmission of many sexually transmitted diseases."

Hatcher reports that since 1960 a dramatic drop has occurred in the estrogen and progestin potency of OCs. Consequently, more women experience breakthrough bleeding, and such bleeding is a common reason for OC discontinuation. Hatcher describes the following 8 ways to manage breakthrough bleeding: encourage and reassure patients; after eliminating pathological conditions, stop bleeding by changing a patient to an OC with either higher estrogen dose, higher progestin dose, or a more biologically active progestin at the same or lower dose; supplement combined pill with short-term exogenous estrogen; change from a low dose combination pill to a combination pill with greater estrogenic activity for 1 or 2 cycles or indefinitely; switch from 1 low dose combined pill to another; discontinue OCs and start a new package in a week; double up on OC dosage; and encourage patients to avoid missing OCs."

They injected 150 cc 0.1% ethacriding lactate into the intrauterine, extra-amniotic space. They used iv infusion of oxytocin to expedite the delivery of the abortus. 59% of cases were unmarried teenagers. Ethacridine lactate induced successful abortion in 92.8% (52) of cases which was much higher than that found in the literature (about 82%). Abortion failure occurred in the other 4 cases because of transverse lie of fetus (2), cervical dystocia (1), and uterine inertia (1). The transverse lie and cervical dystocia cases would have experienced failure regardless of the uterotonic abortifacient used. 3 of the failure cases underwent evacuation while the other underwent hysterotomy. Most women (73.2%) experienced the abortion 12-24 hours after induction. The mean interval was 20.1 house which was shorter than that of previous reports (29.5-38 hours). The shortest induction-abortion interval was 10.5 hours and the longest was more than 36 hours. Complications occurred in 6 (14.4%) cases. 3 (5.4%) women suffered from cervical tear. 3 (5.4%) women experienced incomplete expulsion which was much lower than that reported in the literature (16-30%). On the other hand, the 5.4% incomplete expulsion rate was higher than that for prostaglandin and hypertonic saline. There was 1 case each of severe bleeding and vaginal laceration. The antiseptic properties of ethacridine lactate likely accounted for the complete absence of sepsis in these women. In conclusion, ethacridine lactate performs better than other instillation abortion methods and it is a safe and effective method."

The majority of infected individuals are aged 15-49 years, in their most economically productive years. Local journalism over the past ten years has done well to highlight the problem, raising awareness to levels higher than in many other parts of Africa. Journalists should, however, go beyond their denotative role of collecting and disseminating information in an unbiased fashion, and attempt to sway sexual behavior in a direction which minimizes the risk of HIV transmission. Specifically, 98% of HIV transmission in Uganda is the result of unprotected sexual intercourse between male and female heterosexuals. Unprotected sexual intercourse between HIV-discordant partners must cease. The political leadership, however, remains embroiled in sexual scandal. The masses are privy to such scandal through the press and will certainly not modify their sexual behavior if the elite fail to do so. Journalists and journalism should therefore move away from simply reporting the facts and instead openly challenge political leaders to adopt more responsible sexual lifestyles."

Approximately 200,000 new cases were estimated to exist in south and southeast Asia, over eight times as many as during the previous year. Only 985,119 cases of AIDS had actually been reported to WHO by June 30, 1994 since the onset of the pandemic, however, GPA estimates that about 4 million have actually developed AIDS. GPA estimates indicate that more than 16 million adults and over one million children have been infected since its inception. Close to three million new HIV infections occurred between mid-1993 and mid-1994. The cumulative total in south and southeast Asia reached 2.5 million. The cumulative total in this region is expected to escalate to 10 million by the year 2000 with a serious threat of its spread to China and other countries with a potential of new economic growth. HIV levels have been significant among injecting drug users (IDUs) in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam (increasing from 2% in late 1992 to more than 30% at the end of 1993), in peninsular Malaysia, and in Yunnan province, China. In Bangkok (Thailand), Manipur (India), and Yangon (Myanmar) HIV prevalence rates among IDUs have risen to 50% since the late 1980s. Heterosexual transmission has been on the rise among female sex workers in several Indian states, in cities of Myanmar, Thailand, and Cambodia as well as among fishermen in eastern and western Indonesia. In Thailand over 3.5% of military recruits aged 21 years are infected, and in a northern province HIV prevalence exceeds 8% among women attending antenatal clinics and 20% of military recruits are infected. In industrial countries the number did not change much from mid-1993 because the number of new infections was balanced by AIDS deaths."

Data presented at the XI International Conference on AIDS indicated that adolescents aged 15-19 years form the highest risk group for newly acquired HIV infections and also with the highest rate worldwide of unwanted pregnancy. Contributing factors of this high rate includes physical violence and other forms of coercion; an earlier age of sexual initiation for girls than boys; so-called \"sexual mixing\", wherein young girls may have sex with older men for a variety of cultural and economic reasons; social pressures faced by young girls; the lack of access to formal education including sex education; the lack of access to contraception and reproductive health services; the high-risk sexual behavior of adolescent female partners; and young women's lack of power to negotiate terms of sex with their partners. When faced with an unwanted pregnancy, adolescent women have always found it difficult to obtain appropriate services to meet their needs, including safe abortion care. The AIDS epidemic exacerbates these difficulties and adds new medical, legal and ethical dimensions to the practice of unsafe and illegal abortion procedures that put young women's health and lives in danger."

Although some officials argue that Islamic strictures and traditional social pressures discourage sexual license, the poor public health and education standards in Pakistan make it vulnerable to AIDS. Drug abuse has risen in the last 20 years; there are an estimated 1.5 million heroin users among an estimated 3 million addicts.

Marvi states that the reuse and poor disposal of needles, a common practice in Pakistan, could be responsible for most of the transmission there of AIDS and hepatitis C. Health experts acknowledge the obstacles placed in the way of AIDS awareness campaigns by sex taboos and religious sensitivities; condoms cannot be mentioned or displayed in shops, or used in electronic or print media campaigns. They can be mentioned in a recorded message on a 24-hr AIDS hotline. Community-based and nongovernmental organizations are being used to reach segments of society who cannot use the hotline. Eunuchs (hijras), who are much in demand as \"female\" entertainers at weddings, are particularly resistant to safe sex messages, according to Abid Atiq, head of the information and education section of the National AIDS Program. He says families conceal AIDS patients because of the stigma, and, although counseling services are provided, most are reluctant to contact the program."

        "abstract": "The plight of HIV positive women illegally detained in a remand home in India for an undetermined period due to their HIV status is described. Detention was originally received due to infractions of the Prevention of Immoral Traffic Act (PITA). The rationale for continued detention after sentences were served was to prevent the spread of infection to others and to provide medical care. Women detained were interviewed in March 1989. The initial difficulties encountered were gaining access to the women since the press had been banned. After permission was granted, there were restrictions on cameras or tape recorders and the superintendent was to be present at all times. The 1st meeting was heralded by a call for all the AIDs women to come to the office. There were several passionate outburst demanding release and return to their families and small children. The illegal nature of the detention was recognized by authorities but justified because of the women being considered \"pools of infection\" and a \"threat to society.\" There was no recognition of the means of transmission of HIV infection or the nature of HIV/AIDs by authorities. These prostitutes were infected by HIV-positive men paying to have sex with them. Condoms were not routinely used because prostitutes were unaware of the risk of an incurable disease, and felt that required condom use for paid sex would lead to beatings and loss of work. In conversations with brothel owners, the attitude was that the women were medically well until they became ill; in which case, the women were replaced. There was no recognition that the client could be ill and spread disease or HIV infection. Prostitutes were also concerned that the crime ignored the client, the pimp, and brothel owners. In fact, prostitution is legal, but soliciting in a public place is illegal. In November 1989, the public prosecutor was contacted about the illegal detention, but it was not until a writ of habeas corpus was filed in March 1990 seeking release of 5 of the women, that a response was given. The authorities stated that the girls had requested medical treatment; an advocate commissioner was appointed and determined that the detention was involuntary. The Madras high court ruled on July 17, 1990 for release, and kept no records of their whereabouts. No rehabilitation or education was ever provided, and there is no effort being made to protect prostitutes from infection."

        "abstract": "A semi-structured interview was used to gather data in testing the three hypotheses about family planning in women with schizophrenic spectrum disorders, as compared to demographically comparable non-mentally-ill control women: 1) that they report at least as much unprotected intercourse while not desiring pregnancy; 2) that they have less knowledge about contraception; and 3) that they perceive more, and different, obstacles in obtaining or using birth control. A total of 44 women with Research Diagnostic Criteria diagnosed of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, and 50 non-mentally-ill control subjects were administered with the Family Planning Interview. The interview elicited detailed information about sexuality, pregnancy history, education and communication about family planning, and birth control knowledge, practices and attitudes. Results revealed that the participants had high rates of unprotected intercourse, as did non-mentally-ill controls. They had significantly less reproductive and contraceptive knowledge than the control subjects, and were more likely to perceive birth control as difficult to obtain. The reason most commonly endorsed by women with psychotic disorders had to do with not expecting to have sex, and not thinking about birth control while having sex. It also provides support for the hypothesis that difficulty planning ahead was a major obstacle to the use of birth control methods. These findings underscore the importance of gearing family planning programs to the particular needs of mentally ill women."

Among these are poor access to safe delivery services and contraceptive methods, as well as sexual violence, with consequences ranging from physical and psychological trauma to HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and unwanted pregnancy. Reproductive health care can, therefore, save refugee women's lives and should be given priority in emergency refugee assistance efforts. Critical reproductive health services during emergency phase include clean and safe delivery, prevention and treatment of STDs and HIV/AIDS, emergency contraception, and life-saving treatment for complications of miscarriage and contraception. Within this context, the Inter-Agency Working Group has made considerable progress in strengthening reproductive health services in terms of equipment supply, technical materials, policy and advocacy, as well as research and monitoring and programmatic action. Finally, as access to safe abortion care is increased for refugee women, efforts are being made to prevent unsafe abortion by improving supplies of contraceptives to prevent unwanted pregnancy, emergency contraception, and postabortion care."

        "abstract": "The prevalence of HIV infection is increasing in women throughout the world, and the four basic prevention recommendations depend upon people having control over their sexual relations. In many societies, however, women have no control over their sexuality or over their partners' sex behavior. In areas which have been badly hurt by economic recession, many women and girls find economic refuge in \"sexual networking,\" or exchanging sexual favors for money, gifts, and protection. Women with no economic independence also feel constrained to adopt whatever behavior is necessary to protect their marital status, including overlooking their partner's infidelities. The idealization of virginity in many cultures means that women and girls are deliberately kept in ignorance of basic reproductive and anatomical facts. Virgins are also prized by older men attempting to avoid contacting HIV infections (of course, these men may already be infected). Motherhood also has an elevated status, and no method of HIV prevention is available which also allows conception to occur. A cultural emphasis on male sexual pleasure also increases a woman's risk of infection as women adopt practices such as \"dry sex\" and anal intercourse and as women suffer from forced sex. The following policies and programs would reduce women's vulnerability to HIV infection: 1) improving women's status; 2) supporting the development of a female-controlled preventive technology; 3) increasing availability and accessibility of sexually transmitted disease services; 4) increasing women's knowledge of their bodies and of sexuality as well as their skills in negotiating safer sexual behaviors with their partners; and 5) promoting sexual and family responsibility among adolescent boys and men."

Millions of rural poor individuals in Thailand and elsewhere in Asia are flocking to urban centers in search of survival and better lives. Many, however, wind up working as prostitutes. More than one million children work as prostitutes in Asia, with possibly as many as 200,000 in Thailand alone. These men, women, boys, and girls are at high risk of contracting HIV. An estimated 2.5 million Asians have tested seropositive for infection with HIV, and the World Health Organization estimates that by the year 2000, one-third of the projected HIV cases worldwide will be in Asia, with India and Thailand taking the lead. Existing social services cannot handle the current influx of rural poor to urban areas. In the process, huge tracts of agricultural land are being abandoned, levels of rural and urban poverty are increasing, the extent of homelessness is increasing, and the gap between urban and rural areas grows wider. Thailand has the most inequitable distribution of wealth on the Asian continent."

There has been an increasing demand for free condoms distributed by the government, but they weren't used to promote safe sex. Prostitution in Bombay has flourished into a major service industry. A study in 1993 by WHO revealed 35% of the city's prostitutes tested HIV-positive. Despite the fact that AIDS had spread throughout India, local and state governments were lagging behind in using funds to promote protection against HIV. In 1992, the World Bank loaned $84 million to India to finance its anti-AIDS program, but where a state government was actually using the money, it was either under-used or misused. According to the National AIDS Control Organization, India has 1.62 million HIV-positive cases, up by 60% since 1993. Most hospitals in India still have no blood screening facilities and many refuse to treat HIV-positive patients. Nearly 50 to 60% of blood in the country is not yet screened for HIV, the head of a non-governmental health organization said. Officials, however, balk at the thought of educating a country with the second largest population in the world, rampant illiteracy, and sexual taboos. India's socioeconomic conditions act as a major barrier to controlling AIDS and enforcing laws in regard to HIV-positive patients."

Results were presented from the first national survey of adolescent behavior in the Dominican Republic. The survey was conducted by Profamilia and the CDC from 1992, and documented the early initiation of sexual activity, a high proportion of unwanted pregnancies, and the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases. Similar issues affect youths throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. International Planned Parenthood Federation statistics indicate that 5-10% of all girls aged 15-19 become pregnant. Participants were accordingly urged to more realistically accept that youth people are already sexually active. Mexico's experiences in the adolescent health field were presented during the second day of the seminar. Animated, educational adolescent health films produced by MEXFAM and JOICFP were discussed along with insights on how lessons learned may be used in other countries. Feedback from politicians suggests that survey findings may be called upon during the development of related policy."

However, in so doing, the already stigmatized women would become even more ostracized and the rest of the community would receive the false impression that AIDS prevention does not concern them. A broad-based campaign was instead designed and implemented which reached out to inform and empower the entire community. The AIDS/STD awareness prevention and control program reached into every sector of the district and involved many thousands of its residents as outreach educators, condom sellers, street performers, youth leaders, health promoters, and much more. This is an example of a highly successful and sustainable grassroots project which demonstrates the value of using and building local capacities to design and lead HIV/AIDS prevention efforts."

        "abstract": "According to the associate medical director of the Planned Parenthood Association of Sacramento, clinicians in family planning and sexually transmitted disease (STD) treatment should be concerned with future fertility in 3 areas: the impact of contraceptive choices on future fertility, sexual lifestyle choices, and age of the 2 partners and its relation to fertility. With some oral contraceptives (OCs), a delay of up to 18 months can occur before fertility is resumed, but pregnancy rates subsequently equal those for women discontinuing use of diaphragms or other barrier methods. OCs reduce the risk of hospitalization from pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and the risk of ovarian cysts, but may also increase susceptibility to Chlamydia trachomatis and dysplasia. Women using IUDs have increased risks of PID and ectopic pregnancy, and IUDs have been directly linked to infertility in several studies. IUDs should be thought of as an alternative to surgical sterilization: with the rise in STD rates, IUD use is not the same as it was years ago. Barrier methods have no negative effect on future fertility and they offer protection against STDs. Fertility awareness methods have no obvious negative effects on future fertility, and women using them have more knowledge of their cyclic fertility patterns. Sterilization can cause significant problems if the patient later regrets the procedure. Abortions and term pregnancies carry risks of infection and cervical or uterine trauma. 54% of patients seen in a private practice for in vitro fertilization had irreversible tubal damage because of their contraceptive choices--history of IUD use, tubal ligations, or ectopic pregnancy. Few clinicians or patients can accurately appraise the risks, and clinicians must explain the connection between the patient's sexual behavior and medical problems. The risk of irreversible tubal damage increases from 11% with the 1st attack of PID to 54% at the 3rd. Clinicians can teach patients to identify the symptoms of STDs and should be aggressive in diagnosis and treatment. The question of age, or how long a couple can safely wait to have a baby, has no definite answer. Risks to the woman and fetus do not change as drastically with age as fertility does. Social and economic factors also play a role in decisions about childbearing."

About 500 people with AIDS (PWA) are still alive and it is estimated that just as many people may be asymptomatic carriers of HIV. At the cost of $800-1000 per month per person, approximately 700,000 people, mostly in the US and Europe, are being treated with combination drug therapy capable of managing AIDS as a fairly curable chronic illness. However, most people in Costa Rica, where the per capita annual income is $2500, cannot afford to pay for such therapy. Arguing that the drugs are too expensive, the government has not approved any of the retroviral medications for general use in its socialized medical system which otherwise guarantees appropriate medical treatment to its citizens. The pharmaceutical companies which distribute the medications in Costa Rica, Roche and Bristol Meyers, refuse to provide patients with either free or significantly discounted drugs. The author discusses social discrimination against gay people in Costa Rica and describes attempts made to negotiate drug supplies for PWA with the government and pharmaceutical companies."

This longitudinal study examined changes in condom use as a function of variables from these theories. Risk assessment, \"stages of change,\" and condom use questionnaires were administered to 78 crack smokers or intravenous drug users with a main partner recruited from 2 US towns. Networks of subjects were randomly assigned to a standard intervention (2 educational sessions including basic information about HIV and its prevention as well as demonstrations and practice of correct condom use and cleaning of drug injecting equipment) or an enhanced program (2 additional sessions in which participants set individual risk reduction goals and identified barriers to change). Logistic regression analysis indicated that changes in condom use after 6 months were not predicted by age, gender, ethnicity, type of drug use, perceived HIV risk, or intervention group. Having multiple sex partners significantly predicted increased condom use. The 2 strongest predictors of increased condom use were self-reported assertiveness and the stage of change. High assertiveness at intake (odds ratio, 4.97) and a plan to start using condoms in the next 6 months (odds ratio, 15.49) were significant predictors of an increase in condom use at 6-month follow-up.

        "abstract": "AIDS prevention efforts are confounded in countries where poverty and lack of resources are prevalent. The World Health Organization estimates that about 50% of HIV infections worldwide occur among people aged under 25 years. Adolescents are also particularly affected by high rates of sexually transmitted diseases. One of the barriers to reducing transmission of HIV infections is the ambivalent attitudes of adults to adolescent sexuality. Another barrier is resistance to sex education programs due to fear that sex education promotes earlier or increased sexual activity. The message of \"no sex before marriage\" is not reaching youth. Marriage age is being delayed, but traditional family units are ineffective when students are away from home. Women's low status is another barrier to AIDS prevention. In Zimbabwe, an educational effort is being directed to eight and nine year olds. The message is a warning about \"sugar daddies\" or older men seeking the sexual favors of young girls in exchange for money or resources. In Thailand, AIDS education is incorporated into the primary level schools as \"Life Experience\" and \"Character and Development.\" Positive attitudes and solving personal and social problems are addressed. On the secondary level, the focus is on how students can protect themselves from sexual diseases and on AIDS information. AIDS awareness is taught through writing and art competitions. Prominent artists and movie stars draw attention to AIDS and other adolescent sexual issues. Evaluation of such programs is just beginning. Some preliminary findings from seven evaluation projects reveals that discussion within families increases after exposure to AIDS information in the curriculum, and many school officials are now more aware of the importance of condom use. In Uganda, findings from an AIDS education project show that youth are knowledgeable about AIDS, but actions remain unaffected. The concern is that education is too late or may be inappropriate to meet the needs of adolescents. Information dissemination and skill-building are essential components of AIDS education. Love and intimacy need to be learned in appropriate ways. People must take responsibility for their actions. Risk reduction options need to be offered."

Clients who consistently used condoms take responsibility for both the pleasure and safety of their sexual encounter; their attitude toward prostitution is positive and straightforward. Guilty conscience users are motivated to use condoms by feelings of guilt toward their wife and are ambivalent about their participation in commercial sex. Angst-ridden users are motivated to seek out prostitutes more by loneliness than the pursuit of sexual pleasure; they view their personal risk of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as higher than that reported by consistent users and thus are motivated by fear to use condoms. Defaulting users perceive themselves as the victims of temptation and express a lack of control over the sexual encounter that places them at risk of unprotected sex. Maximum selective users are consistent in using condoms in sex with prostitutes, except when it involves a prostitute whom they see regularly and frequently. Minimum selective users seek frequent contact with prostitutes and base condom use on a subjective assessment of whether the woman is healthy or not. Indifferent users, often disabled and lonely men with no other source of sexual contact, base their condom use or nonuse solely on the wishes of the prostitute. Finally, recalcitrant users are characterized by a desire for power and protest condom use. In general, consistent condom use was related to a positive evaluation of prostitutes, positive attitudes toward the advantages of condom use, an internal locus of control with regard to health, and a higher level of education."

It should consider women's status with their partners and within society and encourage women to challenge those attitudes within personal relationships and society that deny them their right to self protection. Thai society believes it is a man's right to visit prostitutes and have multiple sex partners and that wives and partners must accept this right. Challenging the status quo leaves women open to risks. A prostitute who refuses to have intercourse with a client who will not use a condom could be beaten. There are 6500 women reported to be HIV positive in Thailand, but there may actually be 300,000. Oral sex and heterosexual intercourse are becoming the key modes of HIV transmission. The AIDS epidemic in Thailand affects women 3 ways: they are infected, they pass HIV to their children, and they are the primary caretakers of husbands, children, or grandchildren suffering from AIDS. Men do not perceive themselves as being responsible for transmitting HIV. Many Thais believe HIV's course through society to be: prostitutes pass HIV to male clients who pass it to their wives who infect their children. They do not ask who infects prostitutes. Thai men consider all sexually transmitted diseases to be women's diseases. Encouraging prostitutes and wives of prostitutes' clients to use condoms reinforces this belief. Just 18-30% of men who frequent prostitutes use condoms. Unequal social and legal status increases women's vulnerability to HIV infection. Women have been raised to believe that beginning a conversation with partners about sex means they are bad. The Access AIDS Counselling Centre helps women feel comfortable talking about sex. Thai women must work collectively to bring men's risky sex behavior to light. The sex industry would not thrive if women did not tolerate it."

Two pilot phases of the Dominican Sex Workers and Canadian Tourists Study have been conducted to obtain methodological and empirical data to use in developing a major study of sex and tourism. First phase interviews were held only with beachboys who make money by having relations with female tourists, while phase two interviews were held with beachboys, female sex workers, and female and male tourists. Results indicate that female tourists consider their relations with male sex workers to be primarily social, while male tourists see their relations with female sex workers as more casual, sexual, and monetarily based. Further, women are more likely than men to continue their relationships with sex workers after returning to Canada; many help their men to immigrate and some get married. To learn more about the dynamics of tourism, sex, and AIDS prevention, the author proposes individual studies exploring the characteristics of each of the following four populations: male and female sex workers and male and female tourists."

In the US, one million teenagers become pregnant each year, and 85% of these pregnancies are unplanned. Pregnancy can occur the first time a person has sexual intercourse, and, without the use of contraception, 90% of sexually active teenagers will become pregnant within a year. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can be transmitted during first intercourse, and about 25% of sexually active teenagers (three million) get an STD each year. The best protection against STDs and AIDS is abstinence, followed by use of a latex male condom or a female condom. It is known that many teenagers are afraid to use contraceptives because they fail to realize that contraception is safer than pregnancy and delivery. Common fears about oral contraceptives (that the body need a \"rest\" from their use and that they cause cancer, weight gain, future problems with pregnancy, and birth defects) arise from misinformation. In fact, this type of contraception has many beneficial effects. Similarly, fears about the condom (it is not effective, it may break, it will interfere with pleasure), contraceptive implants (they will hurt, they are not safe, they can break in the arm), and injectables (they are not effective, they cause heavy menstrual bleeding, and they cause cancer) are also ill-founded.

About 61% reported having 1 sex partner in the previous 12 months, whereas 35.2% reported having 3 or more partners. 22.4% reported 2 or more 1-night stands. 54.5% reported worrying about HIV/AIDS occasionally, while 23.1% reported doing so frequently. 17.2% (99) of the students were classified as non-users of condoms, 50.2% (289) as sporadic users, and 32.6% (188) as consistent users. 78 (12%) could not be classified. A multiple discriminant function analysis was also conducted to distinguish among the 3 condom user groups totalling 576 cases. The variables were age, gender, frequency of drunkenness during sexual intercourse, number of sex partners, and number of 1-night stands in the past 12 months, perceived barriers, worrying about HIV/AIDS, perceived susceptibility, condom use self-efficacy, and cues to condom action. Two significant functions emerged. Function 1 clearly separated the sporadic users from the consistent users (p 0.001), while Function 2 clearly separated the sporadic users from the non-users (p 0.001). The discriminating variables correctly classified 64.58% of the respondents into the 3 condom user groups. The variables were most effective at correctly classifying non-users (68.7%), consistent users (67.8%), and sporadic users (61.2%). Sporadic users were more diverse with respect to condom use than the other 2 groups."

        "abstract": "As part of a campaign to prevent a second wave of HIV infection in Australia, passengers on international flights leaving the country may soon see video warnings of the dangers of contracting HIV/AIDS from prostitutes in Asia. Funded by the Federal Government, the campaign is targeted to the estimated 50,000 Australian men who have sex in Thailand and the Philippines each year. The potential new wave of HIV infection could spread among heterosexuals in ways which previous waves have not. Fears of a new wave of HIV infection in Australia result from a marked increase in reported cases of HIV infection among prostitutes in Asia. A number of new cases of HIV infection in New South Wales have been attributed to sex with Asian prostitutes. While no cases of HIV infection in Victoria have yet been related to sexual contact with prostitutes in Asia, high rates of STDs have been reported among men returning from holidays in the region. According to Department of Health preliminary figures, 33 new AIDS cases were reported in Victoria in March. If similar levels are reported in the next 3 quarters, there will be significantly more cases reported this year than last year."

        "abstract": "Most Canadian teenagers have sexual intercourse, but a great many do not reliably use contraception or exercise precautions against sexually transmitted disease (STD). The predictable result of this pattern of behavior is a high level of teenage pregnancy and infection with STDs, accompanied by equally predictable sequelae such as abortion, teenage parenthood, and welfare dependence. This chapter describes the problems of teenage pregnancy and STDs, presents a model for understanding why teenagers expose themselves to these risks, and closes with a discussion of a theory-based intervention to reduce adolescent pregnancy and STD infection. Interventions to promote prevention of pregnancy and STDs must change the way teens feel, think, and fantasize about preventive behavior. Moreover, it is necessary to deliver and reinforce continuously age-appropriate interventions, to yoke interventions to existing community resources, and to overcome potential political resistance to relevant interventions."

        "abstract": "An estimated 1.5% of Senegal's 5 million adult population is HIV-seropositive, with 3000 people having already died of AIDS-related illnesses. Although 75% of those with AIDS are men, women comprise the majority of people infected with HIV. This latter phenomenon is most likely the result of men having become infected before women because of the former's greater degree of travel relative to women. Infection with HIV-2 accounts for 70% of those with HIV, but for only 30% of AIDS cases. HIV-1 is, however, becoming a growing problem since it seems to be transmitted more easily and develop into AIDS more quickly. 15% of prostitutes in Senegal are HIV-seropositive compared to more than 50% of comparable subgroups in most African countries. Experts cannot say for sure why Senegal has a comparatively low rate of HIV, but several factors have been posited as explanations. The comparatively low rate of infection could be related to the long distance between Senegal and the HIV-1 epicenters of east and central Africa, the ability of HIV-2 infection to help the body fight off HIV-1, the strong Islamic influence which has made male circumcision universal thus reducing the risk of contracting HIV, the provision of AIDS awareness and prevention early in the epidemic, and the government's permissive approach to commercial sex. This latter factor is probably the most important related to the current status of HIV/AIDS in Senegal. It has been legal since 1966 to sell sex as long as the sex worker is registered, over 21 years old, has a regular medical check-up, and can present an up-to-date medical report card to the police upon request. This approach was established by then-president Senghor to reduce the incidence and prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases (STD). Registered sex workers since 1986 have been tested for HIV, advised on how to avoid infection, and given free condoms. In anonymous questionnaires, 70-75% of all Dakar's official sex workers reported always using condoms, 20-25% used condoms except in personal relationships, and 5% admitted that they would have unprotected sex if offered more money. Of the 2000 sex workers registered in Dakar, however, only 850 show up for their routine examinations, medical checks have had to be cut from every two weeks to once per month, and the incidence of STDs is not declining. All prostitutes need to register and comply with the rules, but there are currently twice as many clandestine prostitutes as there are registered prostitutes, with many of those unregistered being under age 21. Prostitutes may also be highly mobile, going where single male workers and tourists are to be found, and thereby failing to stay within the officially sanctioned system of commercial sex. Much has been accomplished to prevent the spread of HIV in Senegal, but more remains to be done."

Cuba has 927 HIV-positive cases and 187 AIDS cases (111 deaths) in a population of more than 10 million. Its neighbors have cumulative AIDS prevalence rates at least on par with those of the US. Puerto Rico (around 3 million population) has more than 8000 AIDS cases. Cuba's health system provides for a family physician for every 12 apartment blocks. This physician lives in the community and makes home visits. Medical testing and screenings, including HIV screening, are routine in Cuba. Cuba has the most comprehensive HIV testing program in the world. This program detects fewer than 125 new HIV-positive cases annually. Cuba's successful health system existed before the advent of AIDS. More than 60% of HIV-positive persons are heterosexuals. Many were infected while serving abroad (internationalists) or as sexual partners of internationalists. Cuba considered AIDS as just another health threat and handled it accordingly. It did not worry about offending high risk populations. HIV-infected persons living in the HIV/AIDS sanatoria receive full salaries regardless of their work status and are expected to follow rules that serve to benefit themselves as well as Cuban society. They must accept the three safe sex commandments of the sanatoria before being allowed to leave after completion of a 6-month probationary period. Some patients are allowed to return home after the probationary period. Residents who practice unsafe sex lose their right to leave unchaperoned. All residents receive an individually tailored regimen, which regimen includes exercise, interferon or AZT, and a high calorie and protein diet (5000 kc/day). The Cuban AIDS program focuses on protecting gays, women, and children."

        "abstract": "Results on adolescent's knowledge, attitude, and practice in sexuality and reproductive health are presented from 2 surveys of 1199 middle-class youths aged 13-18 years in main cities of Colombia. Survey populations were selected from high schools and users of Family Compensation Fund. While traditional values and customs prevail among these youths, they nonetheless tend to begin sex between ages 15-18, and have little concern over the consequences of their sexual behavior. They are, moreover, quite ignorant about reproductive health. Sexuality is not thought of as part of marriage, women are expected to be virgins at marriage, and a resounding 87% of the study population rejected abortion legislation. 90% of the young men had their 1st sexual encounter with either a prostitute or domestic servant, while 90% of the young women had their 1st encounters with friends from within their social groups. Sexual relations from adolescence on were supported by 35% of the girls and 60% of the boys, 72% of the girls and 38% of the boys supported virginity, yet less than 10% were in favor of the notion of open relationships. 20% of the girls and 25% of the boys had active sex lives, with homosexuality representing 1.6% and 3.1% of the two sex groupings, respectively. Sex education is practically non-existent. Most young women know little of contraception, and fail to use it out of misconceptions regarding method safety, and fear of one's parents finding out. The young men, on the other hand, cite forgetfulness and inability to obtain contraception as reasons for use failure. Accordingly, 5% of the girls fell pregnant between ages 15-17, with 66% ending in abortion, and 18.6% of the girls and 12.3% of the boys admitted to having had a sexually transmitted disease. 55% indicated that they would not use contraceptives."

Sexual activities which do not involve intercourse, such as masturbation and oral sex, pose no risk of pregnancy and have a lower risk of infection than unprotected intercourse. For couples who want to have intercourse, and know that neither partner has an infection, the most effective form of dual protection is to have sex only with each other and to use any effective form of contraception. For those people who are unsure whether they or their partner are infected with an STI or are at risk of acquiring one, the only effective method of dual protection is the use of a male or female condom, with another contraceptive method, if desired. HIV educators and family planning workers need to discuss protection against both pregnancy and infections with their clients."

Since working-age people spend 75% of their time at work, the African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF), the Tanzanian Council for Social Development, and the Organization of Tanzanian Trade Unions organize and implement workplace-based HIV/AIDS prevention programs. For example, anonymous HIV screening conducted by AMREF at Tanzania Breweries Limited in September 1993 found 11.4% of the brewery's truck drivers to be HIV-seropositive. The men subsequently participated in an informal AIDS education session conducted by peer educators with help from the brewery's STD/AIDS coordinator. These sessions are a regular part of workplace AIDS prevention programs supported by the US Agency of International Development's Tanzania AIDS Program implemented by the AIDS Control and Prevention Project (AIDSCAP).

Local observers have noted a high degree of unprotected sexual intercourse in the Burundian camp and in surrounding villages. Refugees outnumber locals three to one, with members of both groups coming together for sex. Men are even beginning to trade much needed food for sex. The prevalence of unprotected, frequent sex is also expected to rise as Rwandan refugees get settled into their surroundings, but most remain for now too preoccupied with thoughts of lost relatives to think about sex.

Most of the new HIV infections globally are due to heterosexual transmission. In addition, reports reveal that women now comprise 19% of all adult AIDS patient in the US. During the meta-analysis of studies on condom efficacy in preventing HIV transmission and pregnancy among serodiscordant couples, it was observed that consistent condom use provides 87% protection for HIV transmission, comparable or slightly lower than its contraceptive efficacy rating. Condom efficacy was calculated from the HIV transmission rates for always-users and never-users. This paper implies the need for increased accessibility to condoms, as findings from the meta-analysis suggest that condoms may be about as successful in preventing HIV transmission as they are in protecting against pregnancy."

Over 10% of all births each year occur to women 15-19 years old, according to the Population Reference Bureau. The risk of maternal mortality is 2-4 times higher for pregnant adolescents than for pregnant women over age 20. Infant mortality is typically 30% higher for infants born to women 15-19 years old than for those born to women 20 or older. In developing countries approximately 2 million adolescent women resort to unsafe abortion each year and one-third of all women seek hospital care for abortions complications are under age 20. Health problems from unsafe abortion can include infection and injuries from the procedure: perforated uterus, cervical lacerations, or hemorrhage.

Sodji, Action Force for the Improved Well-Being of Mother and Child, Togo; and Dr. H. U. Wagner, Division of Health, Population and Nutrition, Eschborn, Germany), although human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) spreads faster among migrant workers than among those in settled communities in Africa, governments should not crack down on them. The scientists blame the higher rate of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among migrant workers on prostitutes who patronize the workers separated from their families. Their opinion piece, which was published in The Lancet, cites statistics from several studies. In a study of 5000 Ugandans, the rate of HIV infection among people who never moved was 5.5%; among those who moved to a different village, the rate was 12.4%. Similar findings occurred in a study in Senegal. Fear that the government would deport migrant workers if the situation was described has led to silence on the part of researchers; instead, the authors of this essay have suggested educating the migrants to practice safe sex and avoid prostitutes. Dr. Robert Shope, an infectious disease expert and professor of pathology at University of Texas Medical Branch, believes this approach will be unsuccessful and states that molecular studies, which track a particular strain of HIV, are necessary to prove conclusively that migrant workers are spreading the disease."

All of the women were free of HIV infection at the beginning of the study. Over 10 years, 239 seroconverted or began to produce HIV antibodies, while most of the rest were infected to some degree, yet 43 never became infected despite an estimated 500 exposures to the virus.

Sin embargo, las formas en que este riesgo varía entre SM son menos claras. La evolución en la definición y evaluación del estatus de SM puede contribuir a esta divergencia. El objetivo de este estudio fue revisar sistemáticamente cómo se han evaluado la orientación sexual y el estado de SM en la literatura sobre trastornos de la conducta alimentaria y cómo esto puede relacionarse con los patrones de asociaciones entre el estado de SM y los síntomas del trastorno alimentario. MÉTODOS: Se realizó una revisión sistemática de la literatura centrada en los síntomas y comportamientos del trastorno de la conducta alimentaria y los grupos de SM, que arrojó 182 estudios. Se crearon cinco categorías que reflejan la evaluación del estado de SM: solo identidad (n = 105), solo atracción (n = 8), solo comportamiento (n = 4), combinaciones de identidad, comportamiento o atracción (n = 58) y artículos con información poco clara o insuficiente sobre la evaluación del estado de SM (n = 7). Las operacionalizaciones del estado de SM variaron entre los estudios, con evaluaciones combinadas más inclusivas en el trabajo más reciente. Los hallazgos revelaron patrones persistentes y conflictivos de sintomatología alimentaria disfuncional para algunos grupos de SM. Además, las decisiones de combinar selectivamente a los participantes de SM en algunos estudios, con mayor frecuencia para aumentar el poder, disminuyeron la especificidad de sus resultados en relación con el riesgo diferencial y los factores de protección dentro de grupos LGBQA+ específicos. DISCUSIÓN: Los hallazgos resaltan la importancia de las evaluaciones inclusivas de la orientación sexual en la literatura sobre trastornos alimentarios y la investigación centrada en grupos subrepresentados con identidades que se cruzan.

        "abstract": "The AIDS Research Foundation of India (ARFI) began an intervention program with sex workers in Madras where the women reported that they were willing to use condoms, whereas the customers were not. Accordingly, ARFI is focusing on clients using a positive reinforcement approach: repetition of the desirability of condom use by communication. First, truck drivers and dock workers have been targeted. Drivers interviewed by ARFI were familiar with the condom as a contraceptive method rather than a disease-preventing method, and used it with their wives. The ARFI program has convinced tobacco shopkeepers to stock condoms for drivers. Truckers receive key chains with a holder for a condom. At transit site tea shops songs are aired about road and roadside safety sponsored by a tire manufacturer with a message about rubber (tires and condoms). Women selling sex at transit sites are also educated about the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) while attempting to increase their level of hygiene. The typical Friday night sex-seeking behavior among dock workers consists of drinking in a wine shop and soliciting sex workers. Port management and unions have also been recruited for promoting AIDS-related education after participating in health education sessions with flip charts and flash cards. Rest rooms display posters on condom use, some men have been recruited as condom holders for distribution on Friday nights, and barber shops also feature posters with messages about safer sex. AIDS/STD prevention programs have to deal with prevailing practices, values, and beliefs. Results indicate increased condom use among clients as shown by increased sales at transit site tobacco shops and shops around the port. In the future the program will pay more attention to improving the negotiation skills of sex workers."

        "abstract": "Quantitative research methods and epidemiological models dominate research into the understanding of risk behaviors related to HIV/AIDS. While clearly important to understanding AIDS and finding some answers for its prevention and control, quantitative and epidemiologic approaches do not shed much light on how people think. One must also try to understand the thought patterns behind behaviors which we are trying to influence. The author became aware of a mode of thought after 18 months of anthropological fieldwork with traditional healers in Rwanda which has implications for the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS. He described in a previous article a cosmological system based upon the flows and/or interruptions in the movement of liquid substances. Pathological states are provoked or characterized by perceived abnormalities in fluid movement, either excessive flows or blockages. Hypotheses concerning this system were later reinforced when he returned to the culturo-historical literature on Rwanda and discovered that the rituals of kingship were also a rich example of flow/blockage imagery. Tens years after his first fieldwork in Rwanda, the author reports finding ongoing evidence of that cosmological system. While some people in Rwanda who ascribe to the fluid flow/blockage ideology may understand condom use to be a necessary preventive measure against AIDS, they are concerned about the overall effect of condoms upon individual health. Mechanically, concern is expressed that the condom may remain lodged in the vagina and harm the woman or that it will interfere with a Rwandan form of lovemaking called kunyaza. With regard to the prevailing ideology, however, condoms block the flow of fluid. As such, concern also exists that blocking the release of semen from the penis will negatively affect male health. A notion also exists that a gas exits the penis at the moment of ejaculation. Interfering with the escape of such gas, condom use may cause the gas to re-enter the man's body and harm his kidneys. Rwanda is not the only place in sub-Saharan Africa where these beliefs are held. It is important that program planners and implementers understand how Rwandans think about the body and sickness, and tailor communication messages and interventions accordingly."

Male contraceptive methods include vasectomy, condoms, withdrawal, and periodic abstinence (rhythm method). 2 obstacles to expanding male involvement are that more is known about providing FP services to women than to men and limited funding for male-only programs. Male involvement can include use of male contraception and their participation in decision making. Male involvement programs vary from information campaigns, FP services targeted to men, and personal contact through community outreach. Men where instrumental in demographic transitions in developed countries when they used withdrawal and condoms before widespread use of oral contraception. FP programs in developing countries have emphasized women because they faced the real threat of childbearing, these programs precipitated women's emancipation, and governments chose to implement FP through maternal-child health services. Yet this excluded men. During the 1980s, FP specialists began to focus also no men because of the AIDS epidemic and its transmission through heterosexual contact. Women's empowerment increased their ability to discuss FP methods with their husbands. In addition, the more acceptable no-scalpel sterilization technique emerged. FP programs in the 1980s tended to assume men were obstacles to FP and justly so. Yet surveys have found that considerable numbers of men have a positive attitude toward joint decision making about contraceptive use. But it is easier for people to change attitudes than it is to change behaviors. Various strategies to bridge the gap between positive attitudes and practice include youth programs, employment-based programs, peer counseling, social marketing, AIDS prevention programs, and community-based services separate from those for women."

The focus is on key population groups linked to the spread of HIV and STDs in West and Central Africa: migrant laborers, truck drivers, itinerant traders, commercial sex workers (CSWs), and refugees. Countries with high emigration and immigration tend to have high levels of HIV infection, with the exception of Senegal. The main destination of immigrants are Senegal, Nigeria, and Cote d'Ivoire in West Africa and Cameroon, Congo, Gabon, and Congo in Central Africa. The risk of infection and the spread of HIV is variable among migrants. There is little in the literature that substantiates hypotheses about the strong association between migration and HIV-positive status. Information is needed on the duration, frequency of return visits, living conditions, sexual activities with multiple partners, and information before departure, along the routes, at final destination, and at the time of returns. Action-based research in five West African countries (Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Niger, and Senegal) should produce results in late 1998. Comparable studies in Central Africa are unknown. Regional studies should be complemented by local studies. Prevention would benefit from studies on the relative size of these five population groups by geographic location."

Data were collected in three phases: 1) a series of focus group discussions; 2) narrative research component; and 3) in-depth follow-up interviews with selected questionnaire participants. Two aspects of the youths' sexual behavior were discussed: condom use and abstinence as responses to HIV/AIDS. It is noted that as young people have begun to re-evaluate their beliefs and standards concerning appropriate sexual behavior for fear of HIV infection, significant barriers to behavior modification remain. Such obstacles are a reflection of an adaptation to historical, political, and sociocultural factors in their environment. Moreover, factors such as poor communication and negotiation skills, gender stereotypes, and gender power imbalances all hamper sexual dynamics of young people. In view of such, strategies for HIV intervention programs, such as: life skills improvement, acceptability and destigmatization of condom use, consistent condom use, and responsible sexual practice, should be incorporated."

PECOS estimates that the number of cases of HIV is doubling every 2 years. One of the main reasons for the continued spread of HIV is the common perception that the pink plague, as AIDS is called here, affects only homosexuals. While 85% of sexually transmitted HIV and AIDS cases are among gay and bisexual men, in the past 4 years a large number of new cases has been registered among heterosexuals, especially women. In 1987, the ratio of AIDS cases among men and women was approximately 15 to 1. Today, the male to female ratio is 7 to 1. Most people working on AIDS say that the changing profile of the epidemic in Peru is caused by the high costs of prevention programs and the lack of information on the disease, which drastically raise the number of people in high risk groups. Peru's ongoing economic crisis has eaten into the budgets of nongovernment organization's (NGOs) AIDS prevention campaigns and has pushed treatment out of the reach of many people. In 1991, 3 television commercials developed by PECOS to promote the use of condoms were blocked by the Health Ministry. One of the groups that fought against campaigns promoting condom use was the Association of Catholic Doctors. The only way to organize an effective program is through a joint effort that brings together the government, NGOs, and other private and public institutions. Cooperation was demonstrated through the actions carried out for World AIDS Day, when more than 16 public, NGO, and government organizations were involved in a variety of AIDS information activities. In 1993, about 30 NGOs will begin actively working with Peru's Health Ministry to coordinate activities."

        "abstract": "This editorial argues that in order to increase the use of condoms in the fight against AIDS, WHO's Global Program on AIDS (GPA) must address the problems of weak condom distribution and promotion systems. The available data indicates that condom use can protect against HIV transmission. Studies in Zaire, Denmark, Germany, and Australia reveal that seropositivity among prostitutes who use condoms is much lower than among prostitutes who do not use condoms. However, the use of condoms largely depends on whether services are available to the people who practice risk behavior, and whether such people can be motivated to adopt safe sex practices -- including proper and consistent condom use. In order to bring about this desired behavior change, it is essential to have a strongly managed integrated program that combines condom services and health promotion, as well as specific plans and budgets to distribute and promote condoms. In supporting national AIDS programs, GPA's current strategy for condom services includes the following: 1) the provision of high-quality, low-cost condoms; 2) assistance in developing comprehensive program management and technical support plans and budgets for incorporation into subsequent funding cycles; and 3) support for research and development of new methods for preventing the sexual transmission of HIV -- including barrier methods that can be controlled by women."

        "abstract": "Until very recently, no major manufacturer of oral contraceptives was willing to provide concrete education about STDs. Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories recently launched its Nordette Safer Sex Initiative: a pouch containing a pack of Nordette pills, illustrated educational materials about oral contraceptives including health benefits and use instructions, instructions for protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STD), a sample Ramses condom from Schmid Laboratories, and a discount coupon toward future condom purchases. Ortho subsequently released a patient education program/package including a Lifestyles condom. This latter kit includes self-assessment questionnaires designed to help women rate their risk for STDs, and videotapes for both the patient and the provider. The kit is a box containing the sample condom, a pack of pills, a reference card to explain start dates, a question and answer booklet, and an audiocassette describing how the pill works. These collaborative programs between oral contraceptive manufacturers and condom manufacturers is welcomed as a real breakthrough by numerous reproductive health organizations and providers. The Wyeth program is actually a pilot program offered to 16,000 office-based obstetrician/gynecologists, but it is being considered for distribution to federally-funded clinics. For its part, the entire Ortho kit is available only to physicians, but the company is offering some of the material free to federally-funded clinics."

        "abstract": "A contraceptive gel, which prevents pregnancy as well as sexually transmitted diseases, created by scientists at the Johns Hopkins University has been selected for clinical trials by the National Institutes of Health. The gel is a vaginal microbicide that kills both sperm and microbes. It also destroys white blood cells in sperm and cervical mucus that can be infected with HIV. The creators of the gel found out that an effective acidic microbicide should neither harm the cells of the vaginal lining nor kill the beneficial bacteria in the vagina. Thus they created an ¿acidic buffer¿ that would be unable to penetrate the membranes of beneficial cells, rendering the buffer harmless to those cells. Yet, it would maintain the mild acidity which kills sperm and microbes that are sensitive to acid. The scientists are also developing ways to increase the gel's effectiveness by incorporating antibodies and vaccines. Additional research could result in a contraceptive gel lasting for 24 hours or longer. The gel, which they call BufferGel, may be marketed after undergoing extensive tests over the next 2 years."

The proportion of teen births to unwed mothers has risen by 50% in the US since 1980, and by almost 70% in Kenya during the 1980s. Approximately 2 million adolescent women in developing countries have illegal, unsafe abortions each year, with at least 10% of all abortions worldwide occurring among women ages 15-19. Since the start of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, at least 12 million young people have been infected with HIV. In fact, about half of all HIV infections worldwide have occurred in young people under age 25. HIV is spreading rapidly among young women aged 15-24 such that in many countries women account for 40% of all new HIV infections. Several new reports from the Population Reference Bureau, the US Census Bureau, and the International Center for Research on Women offer data on how the world's youth are exposed to unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and sexually transmitted diseases. Maternal and infant mortality among adolescent mothers and their children, coercion to have sex, and the growing proportion of school-aged youth worldwide enrolled in secondary schools are discussed."

The region has the second largest incidence of AIDS in the world after Africa. The number of people with the HIV virus is likely greater than 500,000 and could be as high as 700,000, about twice the previously reported figures. Societal norms encourage homosexuals to have heterosexual relationships, and married men to have extramarital affairs, while poverty forces men and women to prostitution, often with tourists. In addition, a survey of 8100 school children in 4 English-speaking Caribbean islands revealed that 42% of the children had experienced sex before the age of 10 years; 62% had experienced it by age 12. This finding may reflect a high rate of child molestation in the region."

More than 80% of Kenyan men know about family planning, but only 29% currently practice contraceptive use. Men more often than women decide upon contraceptive use and the period of postpartum sexual abstinence is very limited throughout most of the country. 27% of men interviewed in the Machakos, Kajiado, Nyeri, Migori, Mombasa, and Kakamega districts of Kenya had their first sexual intercourse before age 15 years, 63% did so between ages 15 and 19 years, and slightly more than two-thirds were currently married, with 9% having two wives and 14% reporting their intention to marry more wives. The mean rate of total fertility for the men was 7.27 children, due mainly to polygamy and the desire for sons and old age security. The men, however, reported 4.48 children as the mean ideal number to have. Although the majority of Kenyan men have heard about AIDS, they do not seem to be knowledgeable on the modes of transmission. Approximately 48% of men who had extramarital sexual intercourse never used a condom with their wives and 14% believe that they are not vulnerable to HIV. Most men heard about family planning for the first time over the radio and 89% reported having access to one, although the most commonly known sources of family planning methods and information are government health facilities. Recommendations for action are offered."

Data were obtained from 153 truck drivers covering \"Dhabas\" at different highways. Truck operators (TOs), commercial sex workers (CSWs), and iv drug users are the primary at risk populations for HIV/AIDS. In 1997, 73.3% of the 3188 HIV-infected persons were infected through heterosexual intercourse. Findings from TOs indicate a high level of knowledge about STDs, which are prevalent among TOs. Many TOs rely on cleanliness (68.9%) as a safety measure, followed by use of condoms with multiple partners (56.8%). About 50% go for regular check-ups at clinics to avoid the problem of STDs. About 75% of 132 TOs had had at least one problem with STDs during the prior year. About 46.2% consulted a doctor for treatment, 26.5% ignored the problem, and 18.2% received no treatment. 72.7% of 132 TOs had accurate knowledge about AIDS, 62.1% were aware of transmission routes, and 50% knew about prevention. About 85% visited CSWs. Only 14.3% of 112 TOs who visited CSWs used condoms during sexual relations. 10.7% used condoms most of the time, 47.3% used condoms irregularly, and 27.7% never used condoms. Condom availability was an issue. Most TOs learned about HIV/AIDS from mass media, especially posters and banners, followed by the radio. Only 28% of all TOs had complete knowledge of STDs; 13.6% had misconceptions. 37.1% had complete knowledge of HIV/AIDS; 10.6% had misconceptions."

After dropping out of school, he moved to his maternal village where he came under the influence of 4 sexually experienced boys. This peer group would take the boy to places in the evening where drinking and heterosexual promiscuity were encouraged. The boy, who was too shy, was subjected to derision by the group when he did not comply with their wishes. He lost his friends, and his self esteem suffered. In order to regain the friendship of the group, the boy had his first intercourse. This affair was fleeting and was followed by another that lasted 2 months. After returning to his paternal family, the boy began having health problems that were unresponsive to drug treatment. The boy read a copy of the pamphlet \"Know the Facts about AIDS\" and contacted his former girlfriends. One had died 6 months before. The boy went to a hospital clinic for screening. Pre-test counseling was conducted by TASO. The boy tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and immediately thought his death was imminent. This led to thoughts of suicide and denial. The counselor advised the boy that he could prolong his life more than 7 years by treating infections, eating well, getting enough rest, keeping busy to avoid thinking about approaching death, refraining from alcohol and smoking, and getting regular exercise. TASO and the Post-Test Club provide extensive support to the boy. His feelings have turned from anger and denial to hope and acceptance. He has joined the Philly Lutaaya Initiative, a PWA project which aims to change risk behavior and to destigmatize AIDS."

Findings revealed that the subjects, whose only current risk was sexual contact with a drug-injecting partner, were mostly Latino women (62%) or African American women (29%) in their early to mid 30s. One-third had a history with injecting drug use and one in six had previously traded sex for money or drugs. Most of them were presently at-risk for HIV infection; and reported little or no condom use during sexual contact with a male IDU partner. In comparison with FSPs in Long Beach, FSPs in New York: were more knowledgeable about HIV transmission; perceived themselves as being at-risk for exposure to HIV from having unprotected vaginal intercourse with their main partners; have positive attitudes toward condom use; perceived social pressure in using condoms with their main partners; and were more exposed to HIV information from mass media, small media and interpersonal resources. The study generally indicated that FSPs in Long Beach and New York are reachable and reported attitudes and knowledge that support the use of condoms with their main partners."

The programs has been very successful. The sex workers also met condoms as part of their sexual services. Some participants can sell 50 cartons of condoms a month (there are 960 condoms to a carton). They can get the condoms very cheaply through various agencies and can sell them at a high mark up. There are a total of 83 such programs in developed and developing nations. Of this total 72 are all female sex workers and 11 are all male. 36 in Africa, 26 in the Americas, and 21 in Asia. Another obstacle can be the police since prostitution is often times illegal.

        "abstract": "This article describes the efforts at early surveillance of HIV infection in India and calls for continued sentinel surveillance. The fact that Asia was the last continent to be affected by the AIDS has granted India an opportunity to contain the epidemic at an early stage. Seizing this opportunity, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) began an national serosurveillance program for the detection of HIV infection. This surveillance program has given health officials an idea as to the magnitude and major mode to transmission of HIV while the epidemic is still at an early stage. The 1st phase of the program began on October 1985 with the screening of 3027 people from high risk groups; 10 prostitutes were found to be infected with HIV. The 1st AIDS case was detected in May 1986. That same year, ICMR moved on to phase II, a national serosurveillance and clinical surveillance designed to gather information concerning the prevalence and major mode of transmission. The 2nd phase, which ended on October 1987, screened a total of 53,907 persons. 135 HIV and 14 AIDS cases were reported, indicating a low rate of infection even among high risk groups. The 3rd phase began in November 1987 and ended on October 1988. 109,632 individuals were screened, and 387 seropositive and 11 AIDS cases were detected. In 1990, a screening drug users in the state of Manipur showed an extremely high rate of infection. Drug users now compose the 2nd largest high- risk group after promiscuous heterosexuals. The surveillance findings have resulted in intervention measures, but sustained sentinel surveillance will be needed to provide midcourse corrections for ongoing intervention programs."

Les minorités sexuelles sont reconnues comme étant plus susceptibles de souffrir de dépression en raison de la stigmatisation sociale et des préjugés à leur endroit. Notre étude visait à décrire le lien entre l’orientation sexuelle et la dépression dans la population canadienne. <b>MÉTHODE:</b> L’étude a fait appel aux données sur la santé mentale de l’Enquête sur la santé dans les collectivités canadiennes de 2012. L’échantillon comprenait 24 788 Canadiens vivant dans les 10 provinces.

Les personnes bisexuelles, en tant que groupe combiné, présentaient bien une tendance quasi significative de prévalence accrue de dépression au cours des 12 mois antérieurs et au cours de la vie, mais il n’y avait pas de différence claire lorsque les données étaient stratifiées selon le sexe. <b>CONCLUSION:</b> Notre étude appuie d’importantes tendances émergentes en ce qui a trait au lien entre l’orientation sexuelle et la dépression. La recherche sur la santé mentale des minorités sexuelles doit tenir compte des différences entre les minorités sexuelles et éviter de regrouper les troubles de santé mentale en grandes catégories.

This project is just one of 28 efforts in 22 developing countries around the world supported since 1987 by AIDSTECH. Through the programs, approximately 600 peer educators have taught 21,000 prostitutes about AIDS. In all of the projects, the peer educators promote condom use and, in many projects, they also distribute condoms. The peer education model may be the best way to change high-risk behaviors among groups of people not easily reached through formal institutions."

Set in the capital of Accra where over 2,000 prostitutes reside, the projects have a dual purpose: the elimination of prostitution and the offering of a source of alternative income and the distribution of AIDS protection devices. Due to economic problems, many Ghanaians migrated to neighboring countries while many of the young women who remained were compelled to seek income through prostitution.

        "abstract": "Each year 250 million new cases of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) have the potential to cause pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, blindness, and death. Sometimes the onset of these STDs is symptomless, but the following conditions indicate the presence of an STD: genital discharge, sores, wounds, or blisters; swollen glands in the groin; cauliflower-like growths on the genitals; skin rash; lower abdominal pain in females; painful swelling in the testicles; alopecia; discharge from the eyes; and pain during intercourse. The 5 most common STDs which can be cured with antibiotics are chancroid, chlamydial infection, gonorrhea, syphilis, and trichomoniasis. By the end of 1994 in Uganda, 390 primary health units will be available for STD treatment, and most health workers will be trained in STD patient management. Since patients will receive the minimum amount of treatment needed to cure the STD, they will be well advised to use the drugs provided. Notification of all recent sex partners is also essential, and sex partners should be evaluated even if they are asymptomatic. Patients are advised to engage in safe sex behavior, including remaining faithful to a monogamous relationship and using condoms, and to seek medical advice if they develop STD symptoms or are exposed to STD. The AIDS virus is also transmitted through sexual intercourse as well as through blood transfusions, from mother to child, and through the use of contaminated needles. HIV infection progresses from a stage where it cannot be detected to an asymptomatic stage to a symptomatic stage. Chronic diarrhea, fever, and weight loss are the major symptoms. There is no treatment for HIV infection, but zidovudine (AZT) can delay progress of the disease. The most important treatment available is counseling and understanding. The Uganda AIDS Commission works to control the disease through education, treatment of STDs, provision of safe blood for transfusion, monitoring, counseling patients, and promoting research. The primary objective in the care of AIDS patients is to improve the quality of their life as much as possible."

Even though both boys and girls face multiple sexual and reproductive health risks, women are considered more vulnerable because of these three intersecting conditions: unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion and infection with HIV/AIDS and other STDs. Moreover, age, gender-based social and economic factors, and health system characteristics heighten the vulnerability of women.

This study indicates that adolescents are sexually active and would benefit from a forum in which they would safely ask questions about sex, express their feelings, and learn appropriate communication skills. In order to provide this forum, an intervention was designed and tested at 36 schools. The experience of the intervention has been that teachers, if properly trained, can help adolescents acquire skills necessary for making responsible decisions about their sexual behavior."

        "abstract": "The risk of maternal-fetal transmission of HIV is greatest in those parts of the world where the virus is being transmitted heterosexually. Once a woman contracts the virus--usually from sexual contact, or by sharing unsterile injecting equipment with a drug user, or from a blood transfusion--she carries it for life and with it the risk of developing AIDS. The woman also runs the risk of infecting any child she may conceive, before or during birth. Women and children are the fastest growing groups of AIDS cases and new infections. Epidemiologists monitoring the spread of HIV through Central and South America are worried that the Latin cult of machismo may encourage homosexual men to marry and have children in order to camouflage their socially unacceptable homosexual activities. Women who become infected by HIV tend to do so early in their reproductive years, and are faced with a bitter set of choices. Among small groups of women, usually prostitutes, it has been demonstrated that condom use is effective in preventing transmission of the virus. Educating girls and young women about the risk to them, and how to reduce it, is clearly essential, and must overcome the difficulties thrown up by such factors as higher levels of illiteracy among women and their lack of personal autonomy in many societies. Girls need to know about the special risks which HIV poses for them before they become sexually active and, if the epidemic of pediatric AIDS is to be stemmed, must have adequate means to prevent their own infection before pregnancy. Making the necessary information and means of protection available is a high priority for national and global AIDS control and prevention programs."

Some students regularly visit prostitutes and are unconcerned about protecting themselves against AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. The official's firing reflects the reluctance of Indonesian authorities to acknowledge the truth about the changing sexual norms of young Indonesians. That attitude, however, may constrain efforts to disseminate information on AIDS and HIV. Even though only an estimated 0.088% of Indonesia's population aged 15-49 years in 1996 was infected with HIV, medical experts and others who work to thwart the spread of HIV recommend that the country invest in education and behavior change campaigns before the prevalence of HIV grows. In Indonesia, sexual intercourse is the main mode of HIV transmission, with 62.6% of cases transmitted through heterosexual sex."

Data from 615 White and African American college women (aged 18-25) in the US were analyzed. Results indicate that women who perceive their partner as dominant in their relationship may have more difficulty with the interpersonal aspects of safer sex behavior than women who see themselves as equal or dominant. These women had significantly lower levels of confidence in their abilities to negotiate sex and discuss the use of condoms successfully. They also expressed greater fear of the negative consequences of engaging in these interpersonal behaviors. Examinations in the context of racial differences showed that African American women had higher rates of personal empowerment and safer sex behavior than White women. However, perceived dominance did not appear to affect African American and White women differently. Thus, HIV prevention programs targeting women should incorporate discussions on the effects of power in relationships on women's sexual behavior, sexual assertiveness, and communication skills training."

The 2 focus groups of 14 participants highlighted the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV, and disseminated correct knowledge on how the virus spreads. After many group sessions, issues of sexual health began to unfold and they began to realize the importance of addressing such issues openly. In addition, in-depth information enabling the wheelbarrow boys to make informed choices about their sexual health was consistently disseminated. Such successes have been achieved as a result of the relationship which was developed and sustained over the past 12 months. It was noted that outreach to any vulnerable group is always possible as long as ongoing support, respect, and collaboration is provided."

Girls, as young as 10 or 11, are often kept in a separate room; their health is guaranteed and their price is higher.

However, the tissues of young boys and girls are thinner than in adults and rupture easily, allowing direct passage of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into the bloodstream. Medical examinations have shown that sex between an adult and a child usually results in tearing. A female child subjected to sex with several men a day has internal injuries, including bleeding and abrasions, which are never allowed to heal. Because of the high incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), there are many open sores. These internal injuries and open sores provide portals for the virus. This information needs to reach those adults who use children as sex partners. Sex with children is not safe; it is risk behavior that increases a person's chance of contracting HIV."

        "abstract": "Advertising of condoms is beset with problems; 6% of adults oppose it, although 50% thought it a good idea. Despite the Government's AIDS campaign, condom use grew by only 20% in 1987. Of 16- to 34-year old people only 1 in 6 use them. People in the UK, even those at most risk (the under-21s) do not feel threatened by AIDS because they think it only affects high-risk groups, despite the fact that 308 heterosexual people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland tested positive for HIV antibodies in Dec. 1987. Advertising condoms is particularly difficult because they embarrass people. People do not like to use them because they disrupt sex and lessen the enjoyment. People feel awkward about buying them and disposing of them. People also feel that they reduce love to mere sex. One advertising agency tackled the problem by devising television commercials that were short, clear, practical, humorous and humane. The strategy apparently worked; 35-40 million Mates condoms were sold by the end of 1987."

        "abstract": "Malawi, one of the smallest countries in sub-Saharan Africa, has one of the highest rates of HIV infection. Women in Malawi contract HIV mainly through sexual intercourse. Women's economic vulnerability, especially in the current context of economic recession, causes many to partake in sexual networks in which they exchange sex for security, gifts, and other tangible rewards. In so doing, women open themselves to the risk of contracting and transmitting HIV. Most Malawian women believe that proposing condom use suggests unfaithfulness and will lead to violent retribution, while others believe that condoms will slip off and migrate upward into their bodies. Other attitudes and norms shape gender relations and contribute to women's risk. Sociocultural risk factors are discussed. Reflecting the inequality between the sexes and low women's status throughout the country, HIV/AIDS prevention and care activities for women are developing slowly in Malawi and lack sustained interest. Although the link between gender inequality and vulnerability to HIV/AIDS is commonly acknowledged, little is being done to reduce the gender gap in the interest of controlling the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Malawi."

        "abstract": "This paper reports on a project that integrates basic behavioral and need assessment research with program design, implementation and evaluation to promote consistent condom use in the sex industry of Thailand. The project structure consisted of Phase I, which provided a detailed psychosocial investigation into the factors influencing condom use by female sex workers in Thailand. Phase II translated the research findings of Phase I into an operational intervention. This involved an integrated series of stages including pre-program needs assessment, intervention design, implementation, evaluation, and finally dissemination and policy integration. As a basis for open discussion and personal exploration the use of dramatic narrative scenarios on video were used to depict the problems experienced by sex workers. This program was implemented in high and low-income establishments in central Thailand; evaluation was performed through pre/post-test, intervention and control, and quasi-experimental design. Findings demonstrated an increase in the consistency of condom use over a period of 1 month among the low-income intervention group, from 66% (pre-test) to 86% (post-test), while there was no significant change observed among the sex workers in the control group."

        "abstract": "Numerous parallels can be drawn between the systematic destruction of Thailand's forests and the emergence, in the same time period, of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as an irreversible societal crisis. Both the disintegration of the body's defense system implicit in AIDS and the erosion of Thailand's ecosystem provoked by deforestation policies are examples of assaults by capitalist economic policies on previously self-regulating systems. Centralization and industrial development have driven a substantial proportion of young Thai villagers to the cities, where they sell their labor as sex workers (there may be as many as 2 million prostitutes in Thailand) or become heroin users. Conservative estimates project 1.6 million AIDS-infected Thais by the end of 1995. Just as generally benign conditions such as the common cold can annihilate a body ravaged by the AIDS virus, Thailand's ecosystem, degraded by unregulated logging and state-subsidized, for-profit rubber planting, is no longer able to absorb natural occurrences such as heavy rainfall. The loss of forestland--the traditional source of food, shelter, tools, and medicine and the repository of cultural icons--has forced villagers to obtain cash to meet their needs, and Thailand's sex industry offers one of the highest rates of remuneration. Legislation enacted in response to AIDS and deforestation shares an emphasis on the victims (e.g., the prostitutes and not their clients or the owners of sex establishments, and impoverished forest squatters rather than plantation companies and land speculators). A powerful, combative environmental movement is successfully resisting government attempts to destroy living communities. Needed as well is resistance on the part of women growing up in the age of AIDS to societal definitions that polarize females (virgins and prostitutes) and uphold one-sided monogamy."

The following occurred: 1) repeated discussions with female sex workers (FSWs) were conducted; 2) audio and video tapes were produced; and 3) educational materials and condoms were distributed. Knowledge about HIV transmission increased from 18% to 98% in Chengjiang; from 44% to 80% in Ruili; and from 0% to 59% in Longchuan. Awareness about condoms increased from 58% to 99% in Chengjiang; from 55% to 91% in Ruili; and from 55% to 90% in Longchuan. Condom use increased from 31% to 77% in Chengjiang; from 51% to 75% in Ruili; and from 39% to 41% in Longchuan. The Centre prefers to use health workers and brothel owners to conduct awareness programs because of the high mobility and low respectability of the FSWs, who tend to migrate after stays of 2 days to 2 months, and who are hard to enlist in peer education programs."

This represents a 1st step toward establishment of an overall federal AIDS policy. For fiscal 1988, the bill authorizes almost US$700 million in research and education funds to be channeled through the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health to a mix of national and international organizations, state and local governments, and community-based groups. Priority is given to the provision of information and education to the high-risk populations who have an increased chance of contracting AIDS. Where possible, funding is to be allocated to existing organizations that can most rapidly and professionally disseminate information on the AIDS virus. Other provisions of S 1220 include: a national clearing-house on AIDS, national advertising campaigns, a 24-hour telephone hotline, and funds to support clinical trails on drugs and other treatments for AIDS. 2 amendments to the bill are expected to create confusion, however--an amendment proposed by Senator Jesse Helms that prohibits the use of federal AIDS education funds for activities that \"promote or encourage, directly, homosexual sexual activity\" and a counter amendment proposed by Senator Edward Kennedy that requires that AIDS education programs \"stress the public health benefits of abstinence and a single monogamous relationship and the avoidance of illegal intravenous drug use.\""

In Nigeria, programs that integrate STD and AIDS prevention have been developed by the Planned Parenthood Federation. This group has organized leaders from across many professions in the media and in education to create workshops throughout the country. These education programs use films and lectures in post- primary schools, and sex education is provided in schools and social organizations. It is believed that there is a vast underreporting of STD's here, and that few people seek treatment. Since there is no national free public health service, many people get pay chemists who distribute antibiotics. This has caused the development of antibiotic resistant strains, of STDs. The possible explanation for low number os AIDS cases may be the fact that there is a low level of genital ulcers. Recently patients seem to be developing ulcers and hot showing normal STD symptoms, which is great concern to physicians. Since Nigerians have resisted the use of condoms, prevention and control of STDS is even modify their sexual activities."

        "abstract": "The controversy surrounding sex education and condom availability programs in schools in New York City and throughout the US continues because parents worry that such programs encourage teenagers to engage in sexual behavior. But the reality is that more and more teenagers are engaging in sexual behavior anyway. The Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development found the 17% of girls and 29% of boys engaged in sexual intercourse by the time they were 16 years old. Many parents are ready to blame sex education and condom availability programs for these figures; these parents issue calls for \"chastity education.\" Opponents of sex education also believe that these programs violate the rights of parents to education their children about moral behavior and religious values. But the truth is that these programs do not preclude the right of a parents to teach a child anything. They simply prevent the use of the public schools to impose religious beliefs on students. Those who argue that the mandate of schools is only to teach academic subjects forget that public high schools are the best place for sex education and condom availability programs because the schools are full of teenagers and of adults who are trained and willing to counsel them. Few educators would argue that schools should not teach values, and sex education and condom availability programs provide an excellent way to help teenagers understand not only human sexuality, reproduction, and the spread of disease but also social relationships, the development of cultural norms, and the role of responsible citizens. At the same time that we encourage sexual abstinence among young people, we must also teach about sexual responsibility. Sexual responsibility today means using a condom to prevent pregnancy and disease. If teenagers are embarrassed in their efforts to acquire condoms, pregnancy and diseases will be the result, not abstinence."

        "abstract": "Participants at the 1995 meeting of the Society for Adolescent Medicine learned that weight gain during Depo-Provera use may be associated with dissatisfaction and discontinuation among adolescents and that adolescents who were on a diet were more likely than those who were not to be engaged in risky sexual behavior (51% vs. 37.5%, respectively, were sexually active) and to worry about sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy (24.3% vs. 14.4% and 47.5% vs. 24.9%, respectively). In the first study, researchers learned that giving early second injections of Depo-Provera to adolescents did not affect their bleeding patterns and increased the body mass index (BMI) two-fold (e.g., BMI at 3 months, 0.4 vs. 0.99). Teens who used oral contraceptives (OCs) before Depo-Provera were more likely to be satisfied with Depo-Provera than those who did not use OCs (87% vs. 52% on regular injection cycle and 39% receiving early second injections). A possible explanation for weight gain among adolescent Depo-Provera users is that the hormone directly stimulates the brain's hunger centers, thus increasing appetite. The hormone also interferes with serotonin, which influences satiety and stabilizes moods. Another risky behavior among dieters in the second study was alcohol use before sex (23.9% for dieters vs. 14.3% for non-dieters). Heavy dieters were more likely to have been date-raped than both moderate dieters and non-dieters (20.3% vs. 13.8% and 9.2%, respectively). These findings suggest the need for clinicians to screen adolescents for eating disorders before prescribing a contraceptive method. They should discuss dieting, body image, and age at menarche and identify risk factors. Girls who achieve puberty before their peers tend to engage in risky sexual behaviors and to have more depressive episodes during high school."

        "abstract": "Adult ambivalence toward adolescent sexuality makes it difficult to develop and implement and HIV and STD prevention programs. Many adolescents begin having sexual intercourse very early in the course of their lives and they need access to the material and educational resources capable of protecting them from infection with HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STD). There is some evidence that parents in both developed and developing countries are largely in favor of providing sex education in schools. Effective education in such settings aimed at preventing HIV/STD transmission should include biomedical facts, information on transmission routes, and address individual behavior in risk situations. The abilities to make decisions, be assertive under pressure, and use condoms are needed to prevent STD/HIV infection. The author concludes in noting that families could discuss AIDS as an entry point to the discussion of more broad issues of sexuality. Such conversation would complement school-based sex education programs."

        "abstract": "The topic of this article is the use of unsafe abortion for unwanted pregnancies among adolescents. The significance of unsafe abortion is identified as a high risk of serious health problems, such as infection, hemorrhage, infertility, and mortality, and as a strain on emergency room services. The World Health Organization estimates that at least 33% of all women seeking hospital care for abortion complications are aged under 20 years. 50 million abortions are estimated to be induced annually, of which 33% are illegal and almost 50% are performed outside the health care system. Complications are identified as occurring due to the procedure itself (perforation of the uterus, cervical lacerations, or hemorrhage) and due to incomplete abortion or introduction of bacteria into the uterus. Long-term complications include an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic infection, and infertility. Mortality from unsafe abortion is estimated at 1000/100,000 procedures. Safe abortion mortality is estimated at 0.6/100,000. When infertility results, some cultures ascribe an outcast status or marriages are prevented or prostitution is assured. The risk of complications is considered higher for adolescents. Adolescents tend to delay seeking an abortion, lack knowledge on where to go for a safe procedure, and delay seeking help for complications. Peer advice may be limited or inadequate knowledge. Five studies are cited that illustrate the impact of unsafe abortion on individuals and health care systems. Abortions may be desired due to fear of parental disapproval of the pregnancy, abandonment by the father, financial and emotional responsibilities of child rearing, expulsion from school, or inability to marry if the child is out of wedlock. Medical, legal, and social barriers may prevent women and girls from obtaining safe abortion. Parental permission is sometimes a requirement for safe abortion. Fears of judgmental or callous health personnel may be barriers to seeking safe abortion. Some countries lack adequately trained medical personnel and supplies. Mortality and morbidity declines are considered possible with legalization, more trained health personnel, and family planning programs for youth and education for parents."

The program sent trained teams of men only, women only, and both sexes to 3 comparable sites in Kilifi District, Coast Province, an area with a contraceptive prevalence lower than the national average, to reach out to men in places where they tend to congregate, and to include them in family planning discussions during home visits. The community-based agents were local people recommended by community leaders and aged 30-40 years, married with children, and with at least primary school educations. The agents were trained in a 10-day course and the fieldwork program lasted 18 months. Subsequent program evaluation determined that husband-wife communication on family planning improved in all 3 sites, with the most communication between spouses occurring in the program with both male and female agents. The all-male team distributed the most condoms and also did well distributing female methods such as foam tablets and oral pills. The most reported behavior change among men in response to AIDS education was a move toward having sex with only one's wife. Some concern was expressed, especially among men, about male agents making home visits and men were more likely to respond to educational activities when they were specifically targeted to men. Men also reported greater current use of modern contraceptive methods than women and a major positive change in behavior in response to HIV/AIDS education."

Data were obtained from the 1992 National Health Interview Survey and Youth Risk Behavior Survey among a multistage probability cluster sample that was weighted to represent the youth aged 12-21 years. This analysis was based on a limited sample of 4075 youth who were sexually experienced (SE). Initial factor analysis yielded 2 clusters related to first intercourse: substance use and weapon carrying or fighting. Weapons was excluded due to poor internal consistency. Orthogonal rotation revealed 2 cluster factors: alcohol use and illicit drug use. Cross-tabulations were used to identify potential independent predictors. Logistic regression was used to estimate the independent influence of predictors. Findings indicate that most had 2 or more lifetime partners (LPs). The proportion of those with 6 or more LPs rose from 8% at age 14 to 31% at age 21 among females and from 14% to 45% among males. Only 20% of SE females and 13% of SE males reported 1 lifetime partner. Alcohol use, illicit drug use, and young age at first intercourse were associated with increased odds of females having 2 or more partners in the preceding 3 months. Marriage lowered the odds for both sexes. The same 3 factors, in addition to being Black or Hispanic, increased the odds for males. Increases in alcohol-related behaviors contributed to increases in adjusted proportions of recent MSPs from 8% to 48% among females and from 23% to 61% among males."

The intervention, based on health behavior theory and formative research, included publications portraying the experiences of local role models moving through the stages of behavioral change, distribution of role-model stories by peer volunteers, and environmental facilitation through distribution of condoms and bleach. The program was evaluated through anonymous street interviews in control and intervention communities. 71% of at-risk women interviewed in the intervention area but only 2.2% of controls were reached by the project. An increase of about one-third of a behavioral stage occurred in the intervention group, but the increase was significant (p 0.01) only for condom use with non-main partners. When exposed vs. nonexposed women in the intervention area were compared, significant increases in condom use were recorded for exposed women with both main (p 0.05) and non-main partners (p 0.001); the mean behavioral stage gains were one-quarter and one-half a stage, respectively. Increased condom use with both types of partners was significantly associated with perceived condom use by peers, prior experience with condoms, sex work, self-efficacy, perceived behavior control, attitudes, and perceived risk. Likely to be at relatively earlier stages of change were women who smoked crack cocaine, African-Americans, and those with a jail/prison history."

Thailand had reported 12 cases of AIDS, making it the second most affected country in Asia (excluding the Mediterranean region). More remarkably, the Health Department stated that no cases of HIV infection have been ascertained among 15,700 prostitutes, male and female, despite regular testing. Several experts are cited who hold the view that the government is withholding information. The risk of contracting an HIV infection per single sexual contact has been estimated at 1% or less in the West, and perhaps 8% in Africa where sexually transmitted diseases enhance spread, and prostitutes engage in multiple partners daily. In Thailand, sexual practices of female prostitutes are generally limited to vaginal intercourse, and liaisons last about a week with 1 client, so risk is probably under 1%. Prostitutes are generally young, and practice strict hygiene, although they rarely use condoms. The AIDS scare has definitely affected sex tourism, causing closing of bars and massage parlours, and lowering incomes significantly. The industry has reacted by issuing AIDS test cards to girls (although clients are not required to take AIDS tests). No action has been taken in male prostitution establishments, however, where many prostitutes are married or bisexual."

In addition, the fact that 33% of all cases of HIV/AIDS reported between 1980 and 1996 involved 20-29 year olds means that a significant number were infected as adolescents. BEMFAM responded by launching (in 1993) a school-based adolescent HIV/STD prevention campaign in Alagoas state (where BEMFAM found the school in a deplorable state of filth, with every surface covered with graffiti) and in Paraiba state. Today the school buildings are clean, the graffiti is gone, and students are learning to talk openly about their bodies and sexuality. The most innovative aspect of the program is that sex education is incorporated in every part of the curriculum instead of being isolated in a separate course. History teachers incorporate gender issues in their discussions; math teachers use AIDS statistics in class; and other teachers discuss such issues as personal hygiene, sexuality, and unwanted pregnancy. The school staff received 40 hours of training in sexuality, reproduction, HIV, sexually transmitted diseases, communication and leadership skills, gender, and self-worth. A serious implementation impediment is the fact that Brazilian teachers are rotated annually from school to school, and new staff must be trained each year.

Infection rates seem to be increasing in this age group. Despite these revelations, politicians, teachers, parents, and religious leaders impede frank discussion of the subject and the development of interventions to prevent the spread of AIDS. HIV infection in these populations is largely a result of unprotected, high-risk sexual activity. Adopting safer sex practices can, therefore, protect youths throughout the world. Adults must, however, begin to acknowledge the realities of sexual knowledge and activities among youths. Almost universally, the young start sexual relations earlier, engage in high-risk behavior, and experiment in both heterosexual and homosexual relations. High rates of teen pregnancy, abortion, and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) attest to the prevalence and nature of high-risk behavior. With official and community cooperation, AIDS education programs could be implemented to positively exploit the gregarious nature of youth and their susceptibility to peer pressure. Such programs must be conceived and implemented from a youthful point of view, and would prove excellent tools in changing behavior. Young people have a right to complete and objective information about STDs, a right to access to condoms, and generally the necessary conditions in which to exercise their right to information, education, and decision-making options. With these concerns and realities in mind, AIDS prevention education for youth should be priorities for health officials and decision makers everywhere."

        "abstract": "Copper-releasing IUDs cause severe dermatitis (e.g., urticarial eruptions and eczema) in copper-sensitive women. Such exposure of subcutaneous areas is a cofactor for HIV infection. The excessive menstrual bleeding that accompanies IUD use and absorption of virions and infected cells in the semen of HIV-infected males by IUD tails facilitates HIV infection. IUD tails have the highest concentration of HIV in infected women. HIV causes cervicitis in HIV-infected women. The cross reactivity between pelvic inflammatory disease (not rare among copper-IUD users) and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) increases the risk of HIV infection. Having multiple sex partners is a risk factor of HIV/STD infections. IUDs, diaphragms, latex condoms, and spermicides may cause an allergic reaction in men and women. Condoms made of lamb cecum are an option to men who are allergic to latex. The single greatest factor for HIV infections in Africa is chancroid. The sudden increase of syphilis in the US parallels the sudden increase in HIV transmission. Physicians need to consider the following before treating pregnant STD patients with an antibiotic: possible risk to fetus, altered kinetics and etiology of the STDs, and choice, dose, route, and duration of antibiotic treatment. Family planning services should focus on HIV-infected women, so they can avoid pregnancy. Many public health and family planning clinics offer counseling and HIV-antibody testing. Human semen has various subpopulations of leukocytes. Leukocytes that have enveloped sperm can take sperm antigens to the lymphatic system. The great individual variation in frequency of CD4+ lymphoid cells and monocytes/ macrophages is clinically important in infectivity of semen in HIV-positive men. T4+ lymphocytes are in the semen of fertile and infertile men. HIV carriers should wear condoms. Partial inactivation of HIV after 10 minutes in the condom at 37 degrees Celsius occurs, but inactivation varies by trademark."

Women must work with their husbands in the fields or have an alternative source of income. Girls from a low-income family, who are the eldest daughters, or who have younger sisters and brothers must work to feed and clothe the family and to pay school fees. Many women go to Khartoum to find a better life, but few jobs exist, even if the women are well educated. Some women as young as 12 years old sell tea in the street, work as maids for the privileged, or work as sex workers. Some women form groups with an older woman serving as their leader. She promises to protect the women in her group from hunger. Yet, she cannot defend them against HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases. Any woman arrested for soliciting clients may serve 2-3 months in prison. The government has a program for women prisoners informing them about HIV/AIDS and providing them new skills. The IEC (information, education, and communication) coordinator for HIV/AIDS in the Ministry of Health has set up this special program which provides religious advice and handicrafts. The program also shows women prisoners videos on transmission and prevention of HIV/AIDS."

        "title": "\"Final solution\" in Myanmar?",
        "abstract": "The conditions of Burmese prostitutes in Thailand's border communities are described to show how they are mistreated and denied health information on AIDS prevention. The police had been returning prostitutes to Myanmar, until it was brought to their attention that 25 female prostitutes had been fatally injected with cyanide by Burmese authorities to stop the spread of HIV. Myanmar's military rulers have concentrated AIDS education on the military. They do not want the soldiers, who keep the military regime in power to become infected with AIDS. The reports of Burmese murders of prostitutes have come from all quarters. In the group of 25 prostitutes were two cousins of a Burmese citizen who reported the disappearance of his relatives after they left for a shopping trip in the southern Thai city of Ranong, opposite Kawthaung in Myanmar. Thai police found that the two cousins had been kidnapped and sold into prostitution in a brothel in Ranong, which had been raided by police. In the northern city of Chiang Mai, it is estimated that 10,000 of the prostitutes are Burmese girls and women. UNICEF has reported that as many as 40,000 Burmese girls are sold into prostitution in Bangkok and border towns such as Ranong and Chiang Mai. Anti-Slavery International estimated that more than 1500 of the prostitutes in Ranong are Burmese girls and women who have been forced into this work. Their condition is very similar to slavery. Girls are forced to work long hours and may be fed only a bowl of rice with watery soup. Prostitution flourished because 20,000 Burmese fisherman, who are at sea for prolonged periods, frequent the brothels on their return. There is a growing prevalence of HIV infection in Ranong in part due to the fishermen's widespread heroin use aboard ship. In Ranong, 1 in 5 prostitutes were found to be HIV positive including 1 in 3 of the Burmese women. Those locked in brothels are not included in the figures. Unfortunately the Burmese captives know no or very little Thai or English, which means there is no exposure to AIDS prevention efforts. Conditions were reported in a letter signed by 73 Burmese captive prostitutes who wanted to return to their parents. The letter was smuggled out of brothel operating in the Grand Victoria Hotel in Ranong. POlice raids and the return of prostitute to Myanmar by boat have been hindered by brothel owners who bribe officials."

        "abstract": "This article describes trends in AIDS, child prostitution, reasons for prostitution, and strategies for preventing child prostitution in Thailand. The study examined the effectiveness of the Sema Life Development Project in 3 provinces (Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, and Phayao) in 1994. The project provided high school scholarships to poor girls in order to prevent entrance into the commercial sex worker (CSW) trade. HIV prevalence rates among direct CSWs rose from 3.5% to 28.9% during 1989-96, and from 1.6% to 11.1% among indirect CSWs. The problem of HIV infected CSWs is particularly severe in northern provinces. The main reason for girls entering prostitution is to satisfy parents' need for money for material goods and survival. The Sema Life Development Project identified 8 provinces in the north that were the highest risk areas for girls becoming CSWs. Five factors were identified as instrumental to entering the trade: poverty, materialistic attitudes, lack of education, agent persuasion, and family difficulties. The project provided 400 scholarships to day students and 500 scholarships for boarding students. The scholarships helped students finish high school. The project also established CSW information centers and campaigns for preventing prostitution. Interviews with 86 girl students revealed that scholarships were important in permitting continuation of their education and prevention of their entering the CSW trade. The project learned that selection of students was the most important step. Data collection should be improved. Curricula should offer greater alternatives for employment."

        "abstract": "In Africa, normally women bear a disproportionate burden since they must perform their roles as individuals, mothers, and health care providers, but now they must also deal with their own HIV infection or that of family members. In 1988, the Society for Women and AIDS in Africa (SWAA) emerged because there was a need for women to address these concerns, specifically the gaps between men and women in information and education messages, interventions, AIDS policy and program development, and use in prevention initiatives. SWAA pursues prevention activities that consider the deeply rooted cultural beliefs and sensitivities of these women and their socioeconomic realities. It believes that once women have appropriate knowledge and are aware of their problem solving options, they will make decisions that bring about a change in actions which reduce their risk of HIV infection and risk behaviors of their partners and family members. Some of their activities involve motivating women to eliminate or modify practices that put them at risk of HIV infection, e.g., male promiscuity and wife sharing, change traditional norms that make women sexually submissive and nonassertive, and curb female prostitution. SWAA has 5 different regions and the country level is the operational base. Each of the 23 countries designs and executes its own programs, usually with women's health groups. It is branching out into women support networks, counseling, home and community care of AIDS patients, etc. It has been somewhat successful in reducing the misconception that prostitutes are the key transmitters of HIV. SWAA continues to work towards a positive working relationship with the basically male controlled institutions responsible for AIDS policy development."

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between neonatal behavior and prenatal and perinatal risk factors in infants of teenage and older mothers in Puerto Rico and Mainland United States. The sample included approximately 300 newborn infants; half were examined in Puerto Rico, the other half in Florida, using the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale. Comparisons by maternal age and the number of obstetrical complications show that for the Puerto Rican group, infants with fewer obstetrical complications are better able to regulate their crying and active states. Infants of teenage mothers with fewer complications had a higher level of arousal than infants of older mothers with fewer complications. Infant behavior in the Mainland sample did not vary by maternal age or complications. Multiple regression analysis indicates that the combination of biomedical variables significantly predicts neonatal behavior in both cultures. Mother's age is not separately correlated with neonatal behavior, but is repeatedly combined with other variables in the significant regressions. The findings suggest that infants of teenage mothers may differ from infants of older mothers, particularly in the organization of state behavior, and that the effects of maternal age on neonatal behavior are increased in the presence of biological outcome factors."

        "abstract": "A campaign to promote safe sex through the use of condoms has sparked a heated controversy in Uganda, as influential religious leaders have come out in opposition to a practice which they fear will lead to sexual promiscuity. The campaign, backed by the Ugandan government, is designed to halt the rapidly spreading AIDS epidemic. With 20,000 AIDS cases as of June 1991, Uganda leads all African countries in the number of reported cases. Additionally, it is estimated that some 7 million of the country's 17 million inhabitants are HIV-positive. This alarming situation forced President Yoweri Museveni to reverse his stance and come out in favor of the condom campaign. The campaign is being launched by the Ugandan pharmaceutical firm Armtrades Ltd with financial and technical support from USAID and the Ugandan government. The condom campaign, however, has aroused strong opposition from the religious community. Angered by advertisements advising Ugandans to \"love carefully\" by wearing condoms, Catholic Archbishop Emmanuel Wamala urged his followers in August to reject condoms, calling then an insult to the dignity of man. Following Wamala's lead, other top churchmen came out in opposition to the condom campaign at a recent AIDS prevention leadership conference. One of the clergymen present at the conference told Health Minister James Makumbi that the condom campaign will make young people indulge in uncontrolled sexual immorality. Moslem clerics have also stated their opposition to condoms, fearing sexual promiscuity. But the religious community itself has come under criticism for their opposition to condoms. Stressing that lives are at stake, the popular weekly Topic recently cautioned churchmen that this is not the time to engage in academic and moralistic debates."

        "abstract": "In 1989, in response to growing HIV seroprevalences among intravenous drug users and low-fee commercial sex workers in northern Chiang Mai, the Government of Thailand launched a massive expansion of its HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Program. The most ambitious, innovative aspect of this effort was the 100% Condom Program established in 1991 to enforce universal condom use in all commercial sex establishments. Every sex worker is presented with a box of 100 condoms or more when she reports for a regular sexually transmitted disease (STD) checkup at a government clinic. When health officials visit commercial sex establishments, they take along boxes of condoms. Strong pressure, often from the police, is placed on brothel owners who fail to support the campaign. By 1994, over 90% of commercial sex acts were protected by condoms and the number of men presenting to government clinics for STD treatment dropped by 90% from 1989 to 1995. Moreover, the number of commercial sex workers has declined by 25% since 1989. Models of the AIDS epidemic indicate that Thai health authorities should continue to focus on commercial sex for the control of HIV."

Those surveyed were divided equally between men and women. The percentage of adults who believed condoms are effective in protecting against AIDS increased from 35% in January 1987 to 41% in October, but condom use failed to show a corresponding increase. It increased only among men 30-34 years and women 50 years and older. Condom use declined from 32% to 27% in males and from 16% to 13% in females between January and October. According to Irwin Korman, the researcher for R.H. Bruskin Associates who conducted the survey, condom use may be leveling off or many adults already may have made changes in their sexual behavior."

However, recent surveys suggest that these attitudes and behaviors are beginning to change. Jamaican men who once readily had 5 or more sex partners per year are choosing their partners more carefully and staying in relationships longer. Men and women report having fewer sex partners, while young male adolescents are waiting until they are older to begin having sex. This attitudinal and behavioral change may be attributed to the Ministry of Health's HIV/STD control program launched in 1987. The program is comprehensive, systematic, and sometimes uses an unorthodox approach to HIV/AIDS prevention. HIV/AIDS and STDs were linked in the integrated approach."

        "abstract": "A pilot project designed to promote AIDS awareness in schools has given Peruvian children an opportunity to discuss sex for the first time. The project involves teacher training worships, sessions that provide instructors accurate information about HIV and AIDS. During the workshops, the teachers discuss possible ways the virus can be transmitted. A physician leading the discussion clears up doubts and identifies prejudices. The teachers are then encouraged to transmit the information to their students by integrating the subject into their school science curricula. The program also suggests that teachers convey the information through participatory learning, allowing students to debate the issue and ask questions. Such a method allows students to think for themselves and develop confidence and responsibility. So far, 30 teachers from 6 schools have taken part in the workshops. The discussions on AIDS have also given students an opportunity to discuss sexuality, a previously untouched subject for most. The teachers have found that many of the students wished that they had been able to discuss the subject earlier. In one Catholic school in Lima, students said that their parents never discussed the subject of sex. Some of the girls said that they had experimented with sex at age 14 or 15 in order to find out more about it. Many of the girls also reported being pressured into having sex by a boyfriend or relative, and many of the boys told stories of peer pressure to experiment with sex. Many of the children were confused and worried about sex. Fortunately, sex education in the classroom has enabled the students to think about their behavior and develop self-confidence."

The program's conceptual framework emphasized respect for the sex workers, recognition of their profession, and reliance on their understanding. A health service center run by the program provides free syndromic syphilis screening to 35-40 patients a day, primarily sex workers. 65 sex workers have been trained as peer educators to distribute information about HIV/STDs to others. In particular, peer educators encourage other sex workers to attend the health clinic for regular check-ups. The educators also carry condoms with them for free distribution to co-workers. In December 1996, 110,328 condoms were distributed. Cross-sectional surveys revealed that sex workers awareness of HIV/AIDS increased from 30.7% at baseline in 1992 to 96.2% in 1995. The percentage of sex workers who always use condoms increased from 1.1% at baseline to 50.1% in 1995. The program has enhanced the self-respect and professional identity of sex workers. As a result, sex workers are better able to negotiate condom use with clients and to turn away men who refuse."

The project utilized participatory approaches to promote active involvement of local groups and the community in designing and implementing the program. It employs 3 full-time workers who were recruited locally. The 2 major components of the program include improved prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and community-based condom distribution and peer education, whose particular targets involve migrant mine workers, commercial sex workers and the young people. It seeks to maximize community involvement through stakeholder management of the program and through grassroots involvement in program implementation. Despite the number of accesses in mobilizing the different components of the community, enormous obstacles, and challenges still remains. Some of these obstacles include poverty, women's lack of background of a male-dominated culture, and their sense of fatalism, which reduces their motivation to protect their sexual health."

        "abstract": "The incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among prostitutes and their clients is relatively high in the Netherlands, although condoms have been known for a long time in prostitution. As part of the 1987 national condom campaign the STD Foundation developed public education activities targeting prostitutes, their partners, clients, and procurers trying to convince them about safer sexual contact to prevent STDs. Members of the working group Client and Prostitution (KLEP) offered their cooperation. A total of 18 condom distributions were carried out between January-November 1988. About 5000 clients of prostitutes were approached in the redlight districts of 9 towns and cities after members of the KLEP personally had informed prostitutes and procurers by means of leaflets in 5 languages about the purpose of the campaign and guidelines had been drawn up about distribution. Positive remarks were often heard, however, there were also those who ignored the distributors. Some of the positive results included the prostitutes' wish for safer sex and that the procurers frequently handed out condoms to clients in clubs and private houses. A follow-up project in preparation envisions reaching clients after contact with the prostitute, organization of local discussion evenings after condom distribution, and the provision of telephone numbers and addresses. The distribution of condoms frequently prompted prostitutes to inquire about STD/AIDS prevention, thus local and regional organizations might consider launching prevention activities. In November 1989 a report containing these recommendations was to be presented to representatives of local and regional organizations in localities where condom distribution had taken place."

        "abstract": "Regional estimates prepared by the World Health Organization of the prevalence of HIV infections and curable sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) reveal that the HIV epidemic parallels STD incidence and is likely to undergo explosive growth in areas such as Asia where the ratio of HIV to STDs is currently low. HIV has had an especially severe impact on young women, and quickly moves into a general population through the gateway presented by sexually active youth. The impact of HIV has been severe in Africa where it has negated advances in child survival in some countries and created hundreds of thousands of orphans in others. The impact of curable STDs is also severe and is greatest among women who suffer from infertility and in children who develop ocular infection. The sex behavior that places individuals at risk of HIV or STDs is better understood today than ever before as are biological factors such as the increased risk of acquiring HIV for individuals infected with a genital ulcer. The biological and behavioral link between HIV and STDs is so close that the same strategies are important for prevention of both. The adoption of safe sex practices, especially promotion of condom use, is an important goal, and development of a female-controlled method of prevention (especially one that could not be detected by the male partner) would be a valuable alternative to the male condom. The second major prevention strategy is early diagnosis and treatment of STDs through a syndromic approach to diagnosis. Syndromic management will improve with advances in sensitivity and specificity, health-seeking behavior, and partner notification, but the approach still faces major problems caused by the overuse of antibiotics and the asymptomatic nature of many infections in women. While STD incidence is dropping in many countries, the mixture of HIV subtypes is increasing as is the resistance of STDs to antibiotics. With a significant worldwide decline in STDs within reach, complacency must be avoided and additional tools for STD/HIV prevention and control must be developed to avoid a backslide. Research and development of vaginal microbicides, STD diagnostic tests for use in resource-limited settings, HIV vaccines, and new antibiotics must continue."

All interviews were conducted by the same interviewer nurse who was unaware of the diagnoses. Hospital charts were later examined. Educational level of patients, occupation of husband and father, residence, original diagnosis, and religion were similar to those of controls. Less than 1/3 had more than grammar school education. Most husbands and fathers were farmers of unskilled laborers. In only 1/5 of the patients had the original cancer diagnosis been made by private physicians or at noncharity hospitals. About 45% were Catholics, 45% Baptists, and the remaining 10% other Protestant denominations. 49% of the patients and 43% of the controls reported 6 or more pregnancies. Douching practices were similar to controls; few had ever used other contraceptive measures. 13 patients and 6 controls had positive serological tests for syphilis. Only 6, 1 patient and 5 controls, had never been married. Of cancer patients, 47% had been married more than once vs. 16% of controls. 34% of the patients with cancer were married before the age of 17 vs. 14% of controls. 54% of patients with cancer and 26% of controls reported extramarital partners. 53% of patients had 1st coitus before age 17 vs. 26% of the controls. There was a considerably higher frequency of coitus in patients than in controls. It is concluded that no relation between number of pregnancies and cancer was shown. Douching with coal tar derivatives was not a factor. The association of carcinoma and syphilis was not certain as many had never had a serological test. The effect of circumcision of partners was not determined as it was often unknown. A significant association was shown with early marriage, extramarital relations, coitus at an early age, and frequent coitus at all ages."

        "abstract": "Written in 1987, this opinion was republished in the wake of US President Bill Clinton's AIDS prevention media campaign promoting condom use which began January 1994, targeted at young adults aged 18-25. The author staunchly opposes condom use even though he admits that people do not consider abstinence from sex to be a serious option for the prevention of HIV/STD infection. He believes that there is no moral use of sex with a condom and that condoms have always been a sign of immorality, be it prostitution, adultery, fornication, or marital contraception. Likewise, the author laments the success enjoyed by Planned Parenthood in achieving the social acceptance of marital contraception and sex outside of marriage. The complete social acceptance of homosexual activity, however, remains to be achieved. Magazines, newspapers, and television receive income in exchange for publishing or airing advertisements. Finding offensive advertisements which promote the use of condoms against HIV infection, the author recommends writing letters of complaint to the responsible media sources. If the television stations or publications in question continue to advertise condoms to the public, stop watching them or end one's subscriptions to the particular printed media. Such action taken collectively among many individuals will reduce product sales and income, and potentially sway corporate policy against condom ads."

Thousands of tourists visit Thailand annually in search of sex. Empower is an association established in 1985 to help the estimated 4000 women who work in Patpong's bars and brothels. Empower produces the Honeybee Cabaret, performers who enact a series of comedy skits on safer sex targeted to go-go dancers, as part of its efforts against AIDS. Almost twenty shows have been staged throughout Patpong over the past four years with the goal of helping the female audience and their customers to overcome shyness in discussing and practicing safer sex. Responses vary. It is unfortunate that female prostitutes who insist that their customers use condoms are typically beaten by their clients and later by the brothel or bar owner. Customers and bar owners must be taught about the need to use condoms. Empower also runs a center located five minutes by foot from Patpong where the bar workers can obtain information on AIDS and other STDs through videos, counseling, pamphlets, and discussion.

        "abstract": "Noting the difficulty in changing sexually promiscuous behavior, the author examines the available treatments and preventive agents for AIDS. AIDS poses a serious health and economic threat to the world, considering that by the turn of the century, some 40-50 million people will be infected. Infection through sexual contact continues to increase at an alarming rate. 30% of all prostitutes in India are infected with the virus, and in Bombay, some 6000 men get infected through sexual contact with prostitutes every month. In some ways, the AIDS epidemic parallels the outbreak of syphilis in the later part of the 19th century. Despite the lack of cure for syphilis at this time, sexual behavior went unchanged. AIDS differs, however, in that the carriers of the disease can remain symptom free for up to 2-15 years or more. During this period, the HIV virus integrates itself into the host's genetic constitution, targeting the cells of the lymphoid cell system and cells situated in the mouth and genital linings, eventually destroying the immune system. The fields of immunology, virology, chemotherapy, and genetic engineering have made great strides in AIDS research. And despite of a high cost, the drug aziodothymidine (AZT) has succeeded in extending the lives of many patients. But a cure does not appear to be in the near future. Fortunately, condoms and spermicidal agents have been shown to protect against infection. The spermicidal agents Nonoxynol-9 and cycloheximide possess anti-HIV properties. Furthermore, another spermicide, cholorhexidine, can be used as a mouth wash to protect from infection after oral sex. Since history has shown the difficulty of changing sexual behavior, efforts should focus on preventing viral spread."

Condom use with prostitutes has increased to 93%, and fewer men are visiting prostitutes. The key to this unprecedented success is the support of the Thai government and its acknowledgement that commercial sex could not be eradicated and, therefore, that the industry had to be involved in control efforts in a nonjudgmental way."

        "abstract": "Many girls aged 11-15 in Nigeria become mothers either after early marriage to older men or through accidental pregnancy as a result of sexual intercourse with peers. Their small pelvic sizes cause most of these young girls to experience obstructed labor. Unskilled birth attendants simply cut through the vagina to create passage for the baby which results in vestico vagina fistula (VVF), the leakage of urine and feces through the vagina. The malodorous nature of the condition causes the women with VVF to be outcast by society. There are hundreds of thousands of such cases throughout the federation. The IEC Task Force on VVF was therefore established by the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Services to increase awareness, developing educational materials to focus upon the problem, trend, and solution. Institutional problems, however, have limited the achievements of the task force. Two VVF centers have been established in Kano and Uyo, while two nongovernmental organizations are also working on prevention and treatment. The circumstances surrounding the development of VVF in a girl and a young woman are described. An 11.5 year old primary school pupil in Ikot Ekpene, Akwa Ibom State, received no antenatal care and suffered a two-week long labor during which she was transferred back and forth between traditional birth attendants, native doctors, and the church. The forcing of a long stick through the mouth to the abdomen eventually forcefully expelled a dead, decomposed baby. The subject had multiple uteral rupture and underwent twenty repair operations over four years to rehabilitate her. Even so, she may never bear a child or have a husband. A second case, a 21-year old final year university student in the Arts, attended an antenatal clinic for 38 weeks during her pregnancy. She stopped going to the clinic because her church, the Christian Deliverance Center in Akwa Ibom state, prophesied that her labor would be complicated and lead to her death after delivery through C.S. Her labor lasted for three days after which she delivered a dead baby. Profuse bleeding and the inability of her attendants to remove the placenta prompted a return to the hospital. It was then discovered that she had developed VVF, but she insisted upon being discharged before the repair operation arguing that the condition would be cured in her church. The expected healing did not take place, so the woman returned three months later for a repair. Health personnel found this time that she was again pregnant. This second fetus was borne through C.S, then died later due to the overall unskilled interference with her pregnancy. The author stresses the need to lessen the influence of religion on the reproductive health decision making and behavior of women in Nigeria."

Never-married men, Blacks, Hispanics, and younger men were more likely to report using condoms, as are those with a regular sex partner but not cohabiting, those who have had a sexually transmitted disease in the past few years, and those reporting having engaged in risky behavior. 75% agreed that condom use shows one's concern and care, yet 25% were embarrassed to buy condoms and 1 out of 7 think suggesting condom use sends unwanted messages. 71% reported having 1 partner in the past 18 months; almost 10% reported 4 or more partners; and 4% reported none. 50% reported having up to 7 partners in their lifetime; 28% reported 1-3; and 23% reported 20 or more. Formerly married men, Blacks, and those currently cohabiting reported having substantially more partners. Respondents exhibited relatively high knowledge on AIDS risk factors, but 60% assessed their personal risk as none, while 24% frequently worry about it."

        "title": "Anthropology and HIV /AIDS prevention in Kenya. New ways of cooperation.",
        "abstract": "In eastern Africa within the past 10 years, anthropologists, clinicians, and public health specialists have developed a condensed form of anthropology known as Rapid Assessment Procedures (RAP) which uses interviews, conversation, questionnaires, participant observation, and focus group discussions. The RAP techniques are used with triangulation, which involves the use of 2 or more methods to address a single research issue. RAP was established in East Africa in 1989 during a workshop for researchers and health workers involved in AIDS prevention. A group of 5 social and health scientists based at the African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) participated in the training. RAP has proven an effective tool for addressing STD/AIDS prevention among long distance truck drivers operating on the Mombasa-Nairobi-Uganda highway. RAP was used to identify the social and cultural characteristics of the truck drivers. AMREF discovered that the truck drivers, petrol station attendants, commercial sex workers, and restaurant workers along the highway comprised a closely knit sub-culture. Informal interviews were used to discuss individual perceptions, fears, and concerns. A number of factors, such as having multiple sex partners, non-use of condoms, and self-treatment for STDs, facilitated STD/HIV transmission. HIV/AIDS was regarded as an invisible disease, affecting foreigners, and plump women were believe to be free of the disease. Positive AIDS prevention messages were developed by using RAP techniques and focus group discussions. Condom use has increased, and truck drivers seek early treatment for STDs. Communities within the various truck stop points have started planning STD/AIDS prevention programs. Originally funded by FHI/AIDSTECH, the program is now spreading along the major truck routes in Kenya. In neighboring Tanzania, a more extensive program is well underway."

        "abstract": "A number of reports from Australia and abroad, detailing the results of surveys of heterosexuals' sexual practice, have indicated that most heterosexuals are not changing their sexual behavior despite the present context of a global HIV/AIDS pandemic, and despite there being a reasonably accurate knowledge of HIV transmission among survey respondents. However, it does appear that safe sex messages are getting through to and bringing about the gradual adoption of risk reduction behavior among young university students. Findings are reported from surveys of 18-19-year-old male and female students at Macquarie and Sydney Universities during 1987-90. 55 and 66 students were surveyed in 1987 and 1989, respectively, at the University of Sydney, while 700, 564, and 709 students were surveyed in 1988, 1989, and 1990, respectively, at Macquarie University. 45-55% of students had experienced oral/genital sex, 45-60% vaginal intercourse, and 4-7% anal sex. The students generally know that kissing and masturbation are safe sex practices, and they also appear to accept that condom use decreases the risk of exposure to HIV. The most dangerous sex practices were judged to be unprotected intercourse with regular and casual partners, but especially with casual partners, and withdrawal and oral/genital sex with casual partners. When compared with older students, these 18-19 year old students were significantly more likely to use condoms in vaginal intercourse with both regular and casual partners."

        "abstract": "A Unpopulation Division study on adolescent reproductive behavior seeks to provide comprehensive, reliable information for all countries so that policies and program for adolescents can be drawn up on a sound basis. Preliminary results of the study show that for the majority of countries teenage fertility has declined over the past decade, although in a few countries in Africa and in Southern and Eastern Europe small increases were recorded. In most developing countries the absolute number of births to teenagers makes up a high proportion of the total number of births. The health, social, and economic consequences of child-bearing are known to be more serious in younger teenagers than among the older ones of 18-19 years. The large differences in child-bearing patterns among adolescents in various regions is reflected in the age of entry into marital unions, since the majority of adolescent child-bearing occurs within marriages, especially in developing countries. Data on proportions married among 15-19 year olds in developed countries show that in most European countries, fewer than 10% of the young women had married at least once. Overall, for pregnant women under age 18, there are greater risks of morbidity and mortality for both mother and child than for women over 18."

        "abstract": "Improving the quality of life for poor families in preindustrialized nations depends on successful family planning programs implemented concurrently with successful economic and social development programs. Success on these 2 fronts holds the potential for breaking the link between population growth and malnutrition among the poor within this century. Improvement in reproductive performance of fertile women is pivotal to this success. This chapter discusses issues surrounding the fertility consequences of improved maternal nutrition. Improved nutrition during pregnancy is likely to reduce maternal and perinatal mortality and, during lactation, to favor successful breastfeeding. A discussion is presented as to how, given the deprived conditions, breastfeeding with a timely introduction of other foods, appropriately prepared and fed to complement breast milk, should prolong birth intervals through the reduction of infant mortality and lengthened periods of postpartum infertility. Evidence is also presented which indicates that improved maternal nutrition during the period of lactation may, under some circumstances, hasten the return of postpartum fertility. The modernization and industrialization of currently preindustrialized societies and the increasing economic burden which is being carried by poor families is anticipated to create such circumstances. Appropriate natural and artificial contraceptive strategies which are available to protect poor lactating women who choose to limit their fertility are discussed. A plea is made for strategies to be considered as programs and policies are developed and implemented in the critical years ahead in which there is an effort to meet the WHO goal of \"health for all\" by the year 2000."

While the number of abortions among teenagers continues to increase, administrative programs -- especially school health education -- have not kept up with the changing needs of adolescents. So the JFPA begun the Open House, an adolescent health clinic that is managed by 1 full-time doctor and 1 full-time midwife, plus 3 part-time doctors and 11 part-time midwives. Additionally, the organization runs a telephone counseling service from 10 a.m.-4pm.m Monday-Friday. From April 1989-March 1990, the center received 4,490 calls (2692 calls from males and 1798 from females). The most common concern of the male callers were masturbation, ejaculation, phimosis, and the sizes and deformation of sexual organs. For females, the leading issues were pregnancy and gynecological diseases were the leading problems for young men. When conducting a gynecological examination of adolescent patients, the staff often relies on procedures and instruments different than those used at other clinics. Whenever possible, internal examinations are avoided. Above all, the article points out the need for careful communication when adolescents, who may have strong feeling of anxiety. Individual counseling is preferred. Furthermore, the article stresses the need for integrated and comprehensive programs to deal with adolescent problems. Such services would require a team composed of pediatricians, urologists, counselors, social workers, gynecologists, nurses, and midwives."

        "abstract": "Abstracts in the abstracts book at the Abidjan AIDS in Africa conference in December 1997 provide important data on the extent of HIV infection among female prostitutes and their lack of knowledge and prevention. HIV is widespread among Ghana's prostitutes. One survey of 368 prostitutes in the Greater Accra area found that 297 (76%) were HIV-seropositive. Older ages, length of time working as a prostitute, and having had other STDs were positively associated with HIV infection, while the number of clients per day and price for sexual services were not significant determinants of HIV serostatus. 66% of the prostitutes became infected during their first year of work in prostitution, and 80% used condoms with their clients. Another study found that the women are motivated by a sense of familial responsibility, but with only a limited scope for money-earning activities. Over the past decade, the number of prostitutes has increased and they are becoming younger, more educated, and more professional in their approach. 75% of 85 female prostitutes screened for HIV infection in a study in Uganda were HIV-positive and 80% began prostitution for economic reasons; only 66% indicated that they would change profession if given an alternative. A number of the abstracts indicate low levels of condom use during commercial sex acts. Finally, a study in a South African mining community saw a 30% reduction in overall STD prevalence as the miners increased their prevalence of condom use from 13% to 29%."

        "abstract": "This review of the IUD litigation experience of Planned Parenthood in the U.S. from 1977-1988 involved 18 injuries allegedly caused by the plaintiff's use of an IUD. These 18 IUD cases represent 9.8% of the total malpractice lawsuits involving Planned Parenthood in the period. 7 were dismissed, 8 were settled, 1 was decided in favor of the defense, and 2 were decided in favor of the plaintiff. While the disposition of these cases is similar to the overall malpractice experience nationally, it is unusual in that twice as many verdicts were for the plaintiff. It is likely that the public perception that IUDs are dangerous made it difficult to select an impartial jury. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) was the most common alleged injury, 15 of 18. Even though the scientific evidence predicts otherwise, 15 of the 16 cases of PID occurred over 4 months after insertion. 8 of 15 cases involves Copper-7 IUDs, 4 Dalkon shields, 1 a Progestasert, and 2 Saf-T-Coils. The other 2 cases were 1 uterine perforation and 1 pregnancy. Of the 8 cases that were settles, the mean payment was $20,912, and the median $10,000. These payments are about 25% higher than average non-IUD cases. Payments by insurance companies averaged $21,644 in the late 1970s for IUD claims. In jury cases involving IUDs and Planned Parenthood, the average jury award was $50,000. It is recommended that providers take care especially to comply fully with an IUD manufacturer's protocol, and obtain full and complete informed consent with documentary proof to decrease the possibility of an adverse outcome in potential litigation."

        "abstract": "In the last 20 years prostitutes, or sex workers, have formed self-help and advocacy organizations in a number of countries that could have an effect on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention efforts. It is essential when planning a sex work-related intervention to identify sex workers, clients, or third parties as well as any factors that affect the safety of existing sex and drug use practices. It is important to know where sex workers and clients contact each other, where they go to engage in sex, and the working conditions of sex work establishments. Other considerations include the accessibility of condoms and health care; the impact of laws, regulations, and enforcement practices; and the impact of migration of both sex workers and clients. Many projects have involved members of the target audiences in the assessment as interviewers as well as in the design and implementation of the project. All interventions should include current information, education, and communication consisting of media strategies as well as person-to-person strategies. A combination of sites can help to reach the maximum proportion of the population at risk. Several projects have provided bulk supplies in order to ensure access to condoms at no cost or inexpensively to hotels, bars, brothels and other sex work businesses. Projects have also promoted the use of sterile injection equipment where injecting drug use is common. Functioning outreach and education projects emphasize STD service, such as sensitivity training for health care providers to improve services and diagnostic procedures and to motivate sex workers to utilize the health care system. Voluntary utilization may the boosted by offering STD services in a stationary or mobile clinic in the sex work neighborhoods during the afternoon and early evening and combining them with family planning, primary health care, and child health care."

In response, the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation made ZIG-ZAIDS, a game designed to educate youths aged 10-14 years. ZIG-ZAIDS is a board game with question cards on the immune system, transmission patterns, treatment, and prevention. It emphasizes the need for cooperation and solidarity in human relationships, and also helps players reflect upon the psychological and social consequences of AIDS. The game does not attempt to instill panic, and is careful to not associate sex with death. A leaflet is included for parents and teachers with discussion questions on the difficulty and discomfort they may feel about talking about sex, the belief that such talk promotes sexual activity, and the importance of hearing what youths feel and think about sex. A condom and minidictionary of words referring to sexual organs, sexual relations, and sexually transmitted diseases are also included in the game. 34 9-14 year old students at 4 schools in Rio de Janeiro state evaluated the game favorably. Positive change was also realized in student ideas and attitudes about HIV transmission, prevention, and treatment.

        "abstract": "In India, there has been a declining trend in teenage pregnancy between 1977-79 and 1981-84. Teenage pregnancy tends to occur within marriages, often arranged by parents, and few pregnancies occur among unmarried teenagers. There are nevertheless concerns about the higher rates of nutritional and obstetric problems associated with adolescent pregnancy and the ignorance and immaturity which can result in higher morbidity and mortality among mothers and babies. The change to a minimum age of 18 years for marriage has been suggested as a means of reducing the number of adolescent pregnancies. The study sample included 5994 deliveries in the rural health district area of Sirur, Maharashtra state, India, between 1981 and 1984. Adolescent pregnancies (to women under 20 years old) amounted to 598 deliveries, or 10% of deliveries. The perinatal mortality rate among teenage first births to high-risk mothers (238) under 18 years old was 67.2 per 100 births; the neonatal mortality rate was 61.4. Risk factors such as prolonged labor, short stature, and anemia were associated more with women under 18 years old. Statistically significant differences were found in the rate of low birth weight infants, stillbirths, and late neonatal deaths among women aged under 18 years compared to other women. The perinatal mortality rate was 7-16 times greater when associated risk factors, except anemia, were present. The neonatal mortality rate was 2.5-18 times greater when associated risk factors, except anemia and edema, were present. Late neonatal mortality was 2.2 times higher among infants with mothers under 18 years old. Recommendations were to provide general health education about risks of teenage pregnancy, strictly enforce the minimum age at marriage law, screen all pregnant mothers for risk factors, and provide at-risk mothers with education about child bearing and rearing and referral to a hospital for safe delivery. Referrals are particularly important among first pregnancies among women under 18 years old with multiple risk factors."

While these programs achieved a great deal, Brazil in recent years has nonetheless witnessed an increase in unwanted teen pregnancy and illegal induced abortion. An estimated 4 million illegal induced abortions are conducted annually in Brazil, more than the country's 3.6 million annual births. An estimated one million induced abortions occur among teenagers annually, a figure which has tripled in two decades. The field of adolescent health education needs to close the awareness gap between teenagers and their parents who often do not know about the sexual activity of their children. Continuous education is needed not only to prevent unwanted pregnancy and abortion, but also sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS. As for AIDS, recent research identifies it as the major cause of death for women aged 22-35 years and the second major cause of death for men in the same age group. Brazil had 58,595 cumulative cases of AIDS in 1994, with unofficial estimates of up to 1% of the population of Sao Paulo State potentially HIV seropositive. The government and nongovernmental organizations have joined forces to combat AIDS, stressing education for attitudinal change."

Association of intravenous drug use with AIDS is rarely reported in Third World countries probably because there has not been adequate surveillance in those countries. The spread of HIV infection is extremely rapid among intravenous drug users because of the high frequency of injection and the sharing of needles. Drug users usually draw some blood into the syringe in order to be sure that they have injected all of the drug before passing on the needle. In US shooting galleries a disposable needle may be used as many as 50 times. Drug users also transmit AIDS through heterosexual intercourse. In New York City 1/2 of the street prostitutes who were drug users were HIV-positive. In Thailand there are estimated to be 80,000 intravenous drug users. Both prostitutes and drug users are educable. Family Health International developed a training module for peer group education among prostitutes. Campaigns that focus on getting drug users to stop have not been successful, but outreach programs teaching them how to sterilize needles with household bleach are effective, as are sterile needle exchange programs, such as those used in Amsterdam, Sydney, New York City, and Tacoma, Washington. In Thailand the prevention and control of HIV among intravenous drug users has become the number 1 priority in the national AIDS prevention program."

CLP focused on several target populations and set up a team to recruit participants. Participants were recruited on the basis of age, gender, income, residence for at least 10 years in the community, willingness to discuss sex and sexuality, and interest in quality of life issues. Each of the 25 FGDs were formed with a mixture of characteristics among 8-10 persons. 12 facilitators were trained. 4 persons took notes. Participants were recruited through a wide network of schools, trade and professional associations, hotels, health facilities, social clubs, and church groups. The team contacted each identified participant and asked about their willingness and convenient meeting times. Formal invitations with a time and place were delivered and participation was confirmed. The team developed a discussion guide with questions that were field tested. FGDs began with a welcoming. People were encouraged to express ideas in confidence within the FGD and to ignore the rightness or wrongness of answers. FGDs met for as long as 2 hours. CLP discussed the FGD findings at community meetings. One finding was that FGDs offered open talk about a difficult topic."

        "abstract": "Evidence suggest that AIDS prevention messages are not getting through and that people continue to deny the threat of AIDS, developments that underscore the importance of credible messengers. Evidence suggests that myths and misconceptions about AIDS remain common around the world. Even in the US, a 1/3 of the population continues to believe that the virus can be transmitted through casual contact. Although complicated and contradictory messages are partly to blame for the confusion, denial remains one of the greatest obstacles to AIDS prevention. Many people -- especially young people -- simply believe that AIDS cannot affect them. In order to overcome this barrier, effective messengers are needed, and 2 of the most effective ones are people with AIDS (PWAs) and \"insider\" messengers. As Richard Rector, a 34-year-old Californian with AIDS, explains, PWAs have learned to live with the disease, and some have been able to transcend it. Thus, they are able to help people overcome their fear. PWAs humanize the education process. Programs that involve PWAs have been used to educate young people in many countries, including the US, Brazil, Kenya, and Zambia. Another effective messenger is the insider, himself or herself a member of the target group. The use of an insider is particularly effective when the target group in question faces stigma or harassment, groups such as prostitutes and drug users. In Ghana, an AIDS education campaign recruited female prostitutes to serve as educators and to distribute condoms. 3 months into the project, condom use among prostitutes had increased from 13% to 94%. The effectiveness of both strategies is that the education process is not didactic but participatory."

Included in the survey were over 50,000 public and private high school students from all states. The rate of teens who reported having sexual intercourse in the three months preceding the survey remained constant at about 39% between 1990 and 1993, but use of oral contraceptives and condoms at last intercourse rose from 15% to 18% and from 46% to 53%, respectively.

        "abstract": "In some parts of the world, females are the victims of violence before birth as they are selectively aborted in societies which favor sons. If infant girls survive, they are subject to the same domestic violence which affects their mothers and leaves women more at risk of death by a male partner than from any other kind of assault. This issue was brought to the world's attention by the 1985 Nairobi Forward-Looking Strategies and is placed second on the 1995 Beijing women's conference list of \"critical concerns.\" Women are also particularly at risk as they grow older, leave their jobs, and require expensive health care. One way to reintegrate older, retired women into society may be by employing them in child care facilities. Women migrants are also at risk of legal discrimination and physical and mental abuse, yet their plight has gone largely unnoticed as the world community focuses on male migrants. Women labor migrants are in a particularly vulnerable position and may be exploited or forced into prostitution when their legal status expires. The rights of women migrants must be clarified, and women must be informed of these rights. The plight of refugee women is better known, but, although refugee programs are becoming more gender sensitive, it is difficult to overcome old ways of behaving during emergency situations. Women also comprise an increasing number of the victims of AIDS, yet women in many societies are unable to deny having sexual intercourse with their husbands or to insist that their husbands use a condom. These same husbands are free to become infected by prostitutes and to pass this infection on to their wives. The prostitutes are often just as helpless as the wives and usually have been forced into the sex trade by abject poverty. The spread of AIDS, poverty, unemployment, and social disintegration all arise from the relegation of women to secondary status. The upcoming UN conferences will measure their success by how well they incorporate a gender perspective in their proposed solutions to these societal ills."

Barrier methods have never been very popular (5%). Cultural bias may account for some of the avoidance of barrier methods. Men complain about the effects on pleasure and spontaneity. There is uncertainty about what emphasis family planning (FP) programs should place on STD prevention; STD services would make FP popular but also could strain existing services and financial resources. Educational efforts to encourage barrier use are hampered by the lack of access to indoor plumbing, since most barrier methods are messy. Cost may be another limitation on widespread use. PROFAMILIA has been active in promoting the diaphragm and spermicide use. Counseling includes the new vaginal contraceptive film that contains a N-9 spermicide that dissolves on contact. Demand for the film is just now appearing. Research is needed to determine what degree of protection is provided against HIV infections. The female condom is still expensive and men may also find this method objectionable. Pharmacies are the chief source of barrier methods, but pharmacies do not provide counseling. Efforts have been made to teach sex workers with contraceptive messages. Free condoms have been offered in hourly rate hotels since 1987. A study of condom use within these hotels found that most people do not use the condoms (12%) usage. The range of usage varied with the quality of the hotel; condom use was greatest at more expensive ones (28% versus 5% at cheap hotels). A survey of use of instructional materials left in hotels found that 25% of the customers took the printed materials."

        "abstract": "\"Dual protection\" refers to the use of methods which will prevent both unwanted pregnancy and HIV/STD infections during sexual intercourse. Such protection may be achieved through either the use of a barrier method such as a male or female condom together with another contraceptive method, or through the use of the male or female condom alone. In descending order of effectiveness, the following methods can protect against unwanted pregnancy: abstinence; sterilization; Norplant; injection; oral contraceptive pill; IUD; male condom with spermicide; male condom; female condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap; vaginal spermicide alone; and natural family planning. In descending order of effectiveness, the following methods can protect against the transmission of HIV and STDs: abstinence, nonpenetrative sex, long-term mutual monogamy with HIV testing, male condom with spermicide, male condom, female condom, diaphragm and cervical cap, and vaginal spermicide alone. When attempting to provide clients with the family planning and HIV/STD prevention method(s) which best suits their needs, clients' degrees of reproductive health, HIV/STD risk, and motivation must first be assessed. Counseling upon and selection of particular methods may then ensue, followed by skills building of method use and other prevention strategies, follow-up counseling, and HIV/STD testing and treatment either on-site or through referral."

        "title": "Acceptability of male sterilization in Bangladesh: its problems and perspectives.",
        "abstract": "The trend of acceptance of voluntary sterilization in Bangladesh is reviewed. The target in 1965 was the performance of about 600-1000 sterilizations per month in contrast to the insertion of 25,000 IUDs. Subsequent change in program emphasis and local initiatives led to an average monthly performance of about 50,000 sterilizations. In early 1977 a voluntary sterilization campaign accomplished 75,000 sterilizations in 70 days, yet a comparison of sterilization acceptance during the post-campaign period (March-August 1977) shows a considerable decline in vasectomy and a slight increase in tubectomy -- in total a significant decline. The attempt is made to explain the increasing difficulty in making male sterilization more acceptable to the population of Bangladesh. The largest majority of clients expressed either a poor or a mixed opinion about vasectomy. As past acceptors of the method become the predominant source of information, this suggests continued unpopularity for vasectomy. 1 of the most frequent causes of dissatisfaction was that the acceptors failed to receive all the help they suggested, indicating that family planning recruiters possibly made false or exaggerated promises in order to persuade the clients to accept vasectomy. 30.6% of the Shibpur and 18.9% of the Shalna clients experienced severe pain during surgery. 68.8% of Shibpur clients and 57.3% of Shalna clients reported a decrease of sexual or physical capacity. Only about 1/2 of the Shibpur clients and 1/3 of the Shalna clients accepted vasectomy for contraceptive reasons, suggesting that financial inducement can potentially attract men who otherwise did not have any serious urge to limit the size of their family."

        "abstract": "This document provides a regional overview on the AIDS epidemic in the African continent. A widespread difference between regions in the incidence of AIDS has been associated with the socioeconomic and cultural differences. The highest occurrence of AIDS was reported in the three-nation cluster of Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe found in the region of sub-Saharan Africa. A specific subtype C of HIV-1 is transmitted easier through heterosexual intercourse, while mother-to-infant transmission had been the second most common mode of transmission. In the 1998 report of the UN Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS, the prevalence of AIDS was relatively moderate in central Africa, with a low occurrence of HIV-1 subtypes A, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, O, and U. Eastern Africa was found to have the HIV-1 subtypes A and D, with the subtype C making its existence known. Active government prevention programs and strong Islam influence had resulted in a minimal incidence of HIV transmission in western Africa. A rare, less infectious form HIV-2 had been discovered in western African nations like Senegal, Mauritania, and Cape Verde. Northern Africa thus far had eluded the level of devastation that inflicted the other regions, but with the large population of immigrant workers, sex tourism, and injection drug use, increasing incidence of HIV infection is making its presence felt. Government and nongovernmental organizations are making efforts in the prevention and education of those specifically at high risk for infection."

During the workshop, participants discussed lessons learned from working with sex workers and their clients in HIV prevention and care programs in West Africa, particularly in four countries: Togo, Senegal, Mali, and Cote d'Ivoire. The important lessons cited were the following: 1) project success depends on a network of contacts by gaining the trust and acceptance of sex workers and identifying individuals who are widely accepted in the heterogeneous sex work milieu; 2) peer involvement is a key strategy for successful project development; 3) the project can become a place of support and solidarity by strengthening the relationships between the team and the communities they serve; and 4) all projects offered some adapted service package that contributed to the personal development of the female sex workers, such as the Danaya So project in Mali, which offered women courses on trading and business skills and establishment of credit funds. In conclusion, participatory approaches provide hopeful perspectives for future programs addressing the HIV/AIDS situation in West Africa."

        "abstract": "The political constraints slowing the battle against AIDS in Africa are getting AIDS on the public agenda, integrating the international community into the AIDS policy-making agenda and cultural barriers in national AIDS strategies. Policy making in most Africa is bureaucratic rather than democratic, so whether AIDS is a government priority depends largely on perception of AIDS risk by the leaders. In Zambia and Uganda, AIDS is a concern because it affects the ethnic group or family in power, while in Tanzania and Kenya, AIDS is associated with minority or \"high risk\" groups. The domination of AIDS agenda setting within nations in Africa by international donors and non-governmental organizations is a problem, made more severely severed by sensitivity of Africans who perceive research as a foreign effort to prove that AIDS originated there. Foreign domination is also detrimental because it prevents localities from becoming committed to AIDS interventions. Cultural barriers against effective interventions are similar to those in Western countries: AIDS is seen as a disease of shame affecting immoral people. In addition, the prevalent concept of fatalism defeats the Western insistence on intervention and strategies. Furthermore, women who are largely dependent on men cannot insist on preventive behavior, not do they have organizations in place to protect their rights. Finally, the concepts of behavioralism, and learning new behaviors for person-centered reasons, are foreign to much of Africa."

        "abstract": "More than 500,000 hill tribe people with distinct languages and cultures live in Thailand. Extensive reforestation reducing the amount of land which they are entitled to cultivate and a ban on opium production have resulted in increased trafficking of opium and heroin from neighboring countries as well as a higher level of prostitution. The frequent injection of heroin with shared needles, turnaround migration between urban and rural areas, tourism, extensive body tattooing, infant ear piercing under unsterile conditions, and unsterile injection practices by barefoot doctors in the context of prostitution and heroin use bode ill for the prevention of widespread HIV transmission. The government has distributed AIDS information, but most tribal people cannot understand the materials. High illiteracy rates and less than mainstream Thai impede their understanding of explanations about disease. The Health Project for Tribal People therefore developed an HIV/AIDS program which is culturally and linguistically relevant for the hill tribes. The training of village leaders as educators is an important component of the project. Teams of lay people were trained in basic techniques of surveying, pretesting materials, and teaching. Project start-up, the selection of educators, training methodologies, practice teaching, extra support, follow-up, successes and problems, and the next phase are described."

        "abstract": "2 outcomes of the high level of unprotected sexual activity among US adolescents--teenage pregnancy and infection with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)--are produced by similar behavioral factors. Among these are an unwillingness to acknowledge in advance sexual activity, a failure to seek out necessary preventive knowledge, an unwillingness to engage in preventive behaviors such as use of condoms or other contraceptives, and a lack of communication about sexuality in adolescent relationships. Despite this overlap, health educators and service providers have failed to develop an integrated approach for dealing with adolescent pregnancy and STD/HIV risk. Proposed is a sequence of preventive behaviors and skills to be taught to teenagers, including acceptance of their sexuality, education regarding sex-related preventive options, an active commitment to engage in preventive behaviors, the negotiation of sex-related prevention with one's partner, performance of public preventive acts such as condom purchase, consistent practice and reinforcement of preventive behaviors, and the ability to shift preventive \"scripts.\" At the same time, programs must address the potential psychological obstacles to the performance of sex-related preventive behaviors--e.g., negative feeling about sexuality, misinformation coupled with cognitive immaturity, and mass media images and fantasies. Program interventions can be delivered most efficiently through the public school system, with linkages to birth control clinics, STD clinics, HIV testing centers, and drug treatment programs. The type of sexuality education proposed--provision of relevant information that teenagers can actively translate into preventive behaviors--should be anticipated to produce more resistance from conservative community forces than traditional educational efforts."

        "abstract": "This article discusses primary contributors of sexual problems among Korean adolescents. As a result of improved nutrition, physical maturity is occurring at an earlier age in Korean youths. On the other hand, marital age has increased; the average age for males to marry is 27.3 years and 24.1 years in females. Hence, these factors extend the time frame between onset of sexual maturity and marriage. Enrollment in schools has risen; middle school registration has increased from 74.2% in 1975 to 99.7% in 1985 and from 43.6% to 78.3% in high schools. Increased enrollment has also been observed at the university level which may promote prolonged educational periods; this focus on education may reduce sexual interest among students. Improved employment opportunities may also influence sexual behavior among adolescents; urban migration can encourage casual relationships. Changes in family structure and sexual morals has promoted liberal attitudes regarding sexual practices. Increased exposure to mass media has affected adolescent sexual problems; 99.1% of the households in 1985 possessed televisions. These sexual problems include onset of sexual intercourse at an earlier age, unwanted pregnancies, increased induced abortions, and early childbirth. Overall, sexual activity in females has risen from 3.6% in 1965 to 14.5% in 1981 and from 18.5% in 1971 for males to 27.7% in 1981. Pre-marital pregnancy rates have continually increased since 1950; this has resulted in a rise of unwed mothers' consultations which reflects adolescent childbirths. Sex-related crime have also increased; rape ranks 3rd in crimes committed by Korean youth. Sex education and family planning should be provided for adolescents. Furthermore, counseling services should be available to youth regarding unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, and contraception. The Planned Parenthood Federation of Korea provides youth sex telephone services in which adolescents can acquire information on sexual matters. Proposals needing implementation include family life education for parents and their children, sex education and counseling within the school systems, treatment centers for sexually transmitted diseases and pre/post natal care, and youth counseling centers."

        "abstract": "Frustrated with the failure of top-down health messages to change behavior, designers of awareness and prevention programs have turned to peer education as the only effective alternative to prevent the spread of HIV. Peer educators live or work with the people NGO staff or government health workers are trying to reach. Peers, unlike experts, are accepted as equals and can constantly reinforce the prevention message. In Tanzania, the African Medical and Research Foundation (Amref) has applied the approach with great success. The organization in 1989 launched a small project targeting truck drivers and prostitutes along the country's major highways. Both target populations have high rates of HIV-seropositivity. The program involves peer education, condom promotion, and encouraging people to seek treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. NGOs and the government have since joined the effort so that the scheme now covers the entire nation and a range of occupations. Much of Amref's program success is likely due to the organization's determination to ensure that everyone in the community fully understands and accepts the project."

        "abstract": "Condoms must be used correctly and consistently in order to prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and pregnancy. However, consistent use demands sustained behavior patterns. In a project with International Planned Parenthood Federation affiliates in Brazil, Honduras, and Jamaica, the counseling of women has moved away from emphasizing contraceptive methods, side effects, and correct use, to the more broad context of women's sexuality and risk of STD infection as a means of promoting behavior change. Providers use a sexuality-based approach in which they confer with women about their current sex partners, past partners, whether their partners travel for work, whether they think their partners may have other sex partners, and how those factors relate to the risk of STD infection. The project has also aggressively taught men about STDs and condom use, and involves men in counseling. One study has found that people who choose condoms as their main contraceptive method need more counseling than people who use condoms as a backup method, since primary users may have underestimated the difficulty of using condoms at every act of sexual intercourse. Furthermore, counseling appears to increase condom use when it involves both men and women in a monogamous relationship."

Dr. Hilton Wittle, Deputy Director of the MRC AIDS unit, has refused to give the press access to immune prostitutes, in an effort to block any confusion about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) education messages concerning safe sex behavior. According to Dr. Sehu Sabally, who is involved with the research of the British Medical Research Unit in Fajara, many of the prostitutes have never seen a person ill from AIDS and doubt that it exists. 24,000 Gambians, approximately, are HIV positive, out of a population of 1 million. Even those who know their status are reluctant to change their behavior. The messages have had some impact, however, among sex workers; 1 study suggests condoms are used in 50%-80% of encounters. It also indicates that Gambia's educated elite are more likely to have understood the implications of AIDS and changed their behavior. Prostitutes in rural areas are of a lower social class and have more clients. The MRC continues to distribute free condoms to sex workers, including some of the immune women, who ask for them, and people are not asking if safe sex is still necessary. Illiteracy, which has hindered the AIDS education program, has also stopped an overreaction to Rowland-Jones' research."

The research did not test whether N-9 film used alone offers STD protection. N-9 is available in foams, gels, suppositories, and creams. Women who use diaphragms typically apply N-9 cream or jelly to the diaphragm, and some latex condom lubricants also include N-9. The new study involved 1292 sex workers in Cameroon who volunteered at clinics to take part between March 1995 and December 1996. 478 who were provided a contraceptive film containing N-9 and 463 who were provided a placebo film that did not contain a spermicide, completed the study. Volunteer participants who remained at risk of infection were given condoms and urged to use them with every act of intercourse. For the women completing the study, 147,996 acts of sexual intercourse in the group using N-9 film and condoms were compared with 146,942 acts in the group provided with the placebo film and condoms. For every 100 women using N-9 film and condoms for 1 year (100 woman years), 6.7 became infected with HIV, compared with 6.6 HIV infections using the placebo film and condoms. The respective figures for gonorrhea were 33.3 infections for N-9 and condoms and 31.1 for placebo film and condoms per 100 woman years. Chlamydia infection rates were 20.6 for N-9 and condoms and 22.2 for placebo film ad condoms per 100 woman years. A theoretical concern has been whether frequent use of N-9 may increase the risk of STD infections, since frequent use of the chemical may cause sores that could enhance transmission. There were 42.2 lesions peer 100 woman years among women using N-9 and condoms compared with 33.5 lesions among women using the placebo film and condoms."

The 3rd and most recent epidemic affects individuals who are exclusively heterosexual who have never had a blood transfusion, never used IV drugs, and have not had sex with those who did any of these things. The former director of the Center for AIDS Research in Baltimore, MD put out 8 proposals that, if implemented, would reduce the transmission of HIV and provide adequate medical care for AIDS patients. Health and educational professionals must develop improved AIDS education programs directed to those at risk. Since many of them are functionally illiterate, television should carry AIDS education messages. In addition, all AIDS prevention and educational programs need to be evaluated strongly so the country can focus on those activities which are most effective. Those who determine public policy should heed the advice of those who truly understand AIDS. Government, drug companies, and university scientists should all increase research to develop antiretroviral drugs that are not dependent on refrigeration, can be transported rapidly, and are inexpensive. Scientists also need to continue working on a vaccine and determine if an HIV vaccine can indeed immunize entire populations. Moreover affordable health care must be available to all AIDS patients. The present haphazard structure of AIDS treatment services must be recognized and integrated into a system that provides patients with coordinated medical and social services. Likewise, all research, treatment and education programs at federal, state, and local levels must be coordinated so that various players do not bicker over priorities."

        "abstract": "Natural family planning (NFP) is a low-cost, user-controlled contraceptive method void of side effects. Couples who choose to rely on NFP must recognize normal physiological changes (e.g., a rise in the woman's temperature and changes in the consistency of the cervical mucus) indicating ovulation so as to avoid sexual intercourse during the fertile period. Couples must be motivated to use NFP if they wish to prevent pregnancy. Physical or emotional factors can alter the signs used to predict fertility, however. They and other factors can reduce NFP's effectiveness. The pregnancy rate is 3% for perfect use of NFP and 20% for typical use. Training in identifying fertility signs and counseling concerning the need for sexual abstinence during the fertile period improve NFP's contraceptive effectiveness. Many physicians do not recommend NFP. About 14% of women worldwide use some form of periodic abstinence. Concerns about NFP include its efficacy under typical-use conditions, particularly when compared with other contraceptive methods; the need for participation and cooperation of both partners; difficulty in using NFP if women have factors that affect fertility symptoms (irregular menses, infections, lack of sleep, alcohol use, emotional stress, and use of some drugs); and no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. There has been the question of whether NFP increases the risk of spontaneous abortion, since some studies have found an association between spontaneous abortion and sperm or eggs that have been in the reproductive tract for a prolonged period and are at the end of their life span. Recent studies do not indicate an association between NFP and spontaneous abortion, however. Effective NFP training takes about 3 months. Non-medical personnel can effectively teach NFP. In a European study, many women using NFP use a barrier method during the fertile period. New technologies and ways of identifying fertility signs are being developed. Ovulation detection kits tend to revolve around measuring the body temperature or the levels of luteinizing hormone or other hormones in urine."

The AIDS death toll will be high in the US: 180,000 by 1991, but it will be in the millions in developing countries. In Africa, AIDS is mainly transmitted heterosexually, is as prevalent among women as among men, and is taking a serious toll among professional classes and young wage earners. The social costs of funerals has increased, and company clinics and sick pay funds have been overwhelmed. In Uganda, the epidemic adds to the state of psychological shock people have sufferred because of the civil war. Medical professionals have been hard-pressed to acquire equipment for testing blood for the virus, although there have been efforts to protect blood supplies through exhaustive testing. Endemic tuberculosis becomes an even more serious problem in developing countries, since AIDS lowers resistance to it. AIDS also effects many developing country children, usually through infected mothers, who can transmit AIDS through breast milk or during pregnancy of birth. This poses a dilemma for promoters of breastfeeding. It is also feared that innoculation of immunosuppressed children may be dangerous. The global picture suggests that Africa is hardest hit: seropositivity prevalence ranges from 0.7% of Congo blood donors to 33% of male donors in Lusaka Zambia. Brazil's cases are mainly homosexual, and in Asia the prevalence is mostly low, although there is a great potential danger in countries where prostitution and heroin addiction are prevalent. The only effective weapon against AIDS is education and blood testing to prevent spread. Despite good education programs in some countries, e.g. Rwanda, there is still widespread ignorance of how AIDS is spread."

It was found that although 55% of the teenagers believed their parents to be their most complete and reliable source of information about contraception and sex, they actually received more information from school sources. The respondents indicated that 54% of their parents had failed to discuss contraception with them, and 45% of the parents had not discussed sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). In many cases, parents waited until \"too late\" to broach these subjects. Information about contraception was usually too general to be of practical use. The survey also revealed that the teenagers exhibited inconsistent use of contraception. While 55% of the sexually active teens indicated that they worry about pregnancy, only 48% stated that they always use contraception. When asked why teenagers had unplanned pregnancies, most responded that the teenagers felt immune from pregnancy, indicating a need for more information about the specific risks of pregnancy. About half of the young people believe that teenagers have sexual intercourse because they think they are ready. The other reason cited by more than half of the respondents was to increase popularity. Teenagers, thus, need specific information about how to prevent pregnancy and STDs and about how to resist pressure to have sex (and avoid situations, such as alcohol or drug use, which are conducive to sexual behavior). While 69% of the respondents recognize teen pregnancy as a \"big\" problem, they have unrealistic expectations about their ability (should they become pregnant) to finish high school or to marry the mother/father of the child, and they underestimate their potential need for public assistance or their willingness to resort to abortion."

Considering that sexual contact is the most common mode of transmission of HIV, researchers from the SV Medical College at Tirupati conducted a surveillance for HIV infection among patients attending an STD clinic. From January 1988 to April 1989, the researchers collected serum samples from 2320 patients. 11 people were found to be infected with HIV, 1 of whom exhibited the AIDS Related Complex (ARC). 9 out the HIV-infected patients were 20-30 year-old males categorized as heterosexually promiscuous; the remaining 2 seropositive patients were female prostitutes. The seropositivity rate among heterosexually promiscuous males was 0.58%, and 6.7% among female prostitutes (the total seropositivity rate was 0.47%). Among the HIV-infected patients, the most commonly associated STD was syphilis. 5 of the patients had syphilis alone, and 2 others had syphilis and another STD. One of the HIV-infected patients, a 50 year-old heterosexual male with a history of multiple partners, suffered from a nonhealing genital ulcer and inguinal buboes of 1 month duration. A biopsy of the genital ulcer revealed a pattern consistent with that of granuloma venereum. He also developed angular stomatitis which did not respond to B complex therapy. Furthermore, suffering from persistent lymphadenopathy, weight loss, slight thrombo-cytopenia, an opportunistic infection in the form of oral candidosis and persistent seropositivity for HIV antibodies, the patient was deemed to have the AIDS Related Complex. Tirupati's seropositivity rate of .47% was higher that noticed in other parts of the country, leading the authors call for a plan to investigate the problems of HIV-infected people."

        "abstract": "An innovative AIDS control program targeting sex workers and clients in Ethiopia has shown that hard work and government support are essential for the success of a program. Serosurveys conducted in 1988 and 1989 had shown that certain groups were particularly vulnerable to HIV infection: women who engage in formal or informal prostitution and their clients -- often migrant workers or truck drivers. So in mid-1990, Ethiopia's Department of AIDS Control (DAC) launched an intervention effort targeting these high-risk groups, a program entitled the Multiple Partner Sexual Contact (MPSC) Female and Male Mobilization and Condom Promotion Project. The program had a 3-layer strategy: 1) establishing a \"trickle down\" training process, which would create a network of MPSC peer educators and organizers; 2) identifying MPSC men to serve as educators for other men; and 3) ensuring the widespread availability of condoms for both men and women. As site for its pilot project, DAC selected Nazareth, a trading city of more than 30% among MPSC females. After 6 months of operation, the program's effectiveness convinced DAC to expand the project to 9 additional sites. An evaluation of the project has revealed several important findings: 1) retraining and motivation sessions must be constantly maintained; 2) men's resistance to condom use may be diminished by targeting them with education at the same time as the women; 3) interventions that take into account the socioeconomic issues faced by MPSC women make the program more effective; 4) it is important to develop new educational materials periodically; and 5) involving the owners and managers of sex-related businesses makes the program more effective."

A 1986 Harris Poll found that 69% of 12-17-year-old females indicated they postpone visiting family planning clinics because of this fear. 30% of the participants in the Pennsylvania project admitted they were afraid of being examined by a physician. The Smart Start project permits teenagers to postpone the pelvic examination and blood work for up to 6 months after the initial clinic visit. OCs are provided at the 1st visit (foam and condoms are also offered) if there are no contraindications, but OC acceptors are contacted by phone 5-10 days after initiation of OC use and must return for 3 and 6-month follow-up visits. At present, 33% of girls in the Smart Start project are choosing to delay their pelvic examination. There are no data available yet as to whether this option leads adolescents to seek contraception earlier. No significant differences have been noted, however, between those who undergo pelvic examination at the 1st visit and those who elect to postpone it in terms of OC continuation and attendance at the 6-month follow-up. To address possible medical implications of this approach, teens who are at risk of a sexually transmitted disease or have missed a menstrual period are not permitted to delay the pelvic examination."

        "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) ranks Cote d'Ivoire as the sixth worst affected country in Africa in terms of the number of AIDS cases. WHO figures indicate the presence of 6836 AIDS cases in Cote d'Ivoire, but doctors believe the actual prevalence to be about 7 times greater. By 2001, it is thought that as many as 30,000 AIDS-related deaths will occur annually in the country. Abidjan is particularly affected by HIV infection and AIDS, with AIDS being the main cause of death among adult men in the city and the second leading cause of death among women. 15% of blood donors, an estimated 50% of the city's prostitutes, and 12% of women in Abidjan's pediatric wards are infected with HIV. The level of HIV infection among mothers on the pediatric wards alone means that approximately 3300 HIV-infected babies are born annually in the city. Abidjan has a thriving commercial sex industry and district in which many prostitutes have sexual intercourse without using a condom even though they may be aware of the risk of HIV infection. It is difficult for the women who want to use condoms to convince their male clients to do so when the clients can easily find other prostitutes who will have unprotected sex. Women who would otherwise protect themselves are therefore forced to have unprotected sex if they want to stay in business. Educational programs designed to change behavior have remained ineffective. Official lassitude about the threat of HIV/AIDS and general ignorance and disbelief in the population about the epidemic have facilitated the spread of HIV in Cote d'Ivoire. Programs to market condoms and educate prostitutes are being launched."

        "abstract": "In order to reduce the high rate of abortions among its workers, the textile industry in the USSR's Iwanovo district has begun a program to reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies. In many areas of the USSR, including Iwanovo, abortion remains the leading method of regulating child birth. In Iwanovo, the textile industry employs the majority of the women in the district. 83% of all textile women workers are of fertile age. Usually, these women begin their sexual lives at an early age. 75-80% of all female workers under 18 years of age are already sexually active. 3/4 of the women workers suffer from gynecological pathology, with colpitis and cervical erosion being the most common. A woman worker in Iwanovo has an average 3.9 pregnancies. But only 1.5 of the babies are delivered; 2.2 pregnancies are interrupted by abortion. In order to address the high rate of morbidity and abortions among the women, the textile enterprise has established the Women's Consulting Clinic, which is staffed by obstetrician-gynecologists. The clinic provides examinations and consultations on contraceptive use, family planning consultations for married couples, and treatment for gynecological diseases. The clinic also monitors the contraceptive use of the workers, and provides a constant flow of information on family planning through a newsletter. In its promotion of family planning, the clinic generally recommends the use of IUDs and oral contraceptives. The creation of the clinic has led to a 42% decrease in the number of abortions between 1986-90. At 850 abortions/1000 live births in 1986, the abortion rate has dropped to 500/1000 in 1990."

A 2-year study was conducted in Cameroon to determine whether nonoxynol-9 in film form blocks the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Family Health International participated in the study supported by the US National Institutes of Health. Almost 1300 female prostitutes were followed, 941 of whom completed a 1-year follow-up. All of the study participants were counseled, given condoms, and treated for other STDs. Half of the women were given vaginal film containing nonoxynol-9 and half were given a placebo film. However, the HIV transmission rate among the women over the course of the study period was 6.7% in both groups. These findings suggest that nonoxynol-9 failed to block HIV transmission. Nonoxynol-9 also did not protect against the transmission of gonorrhea and chlamydia. Counseling, condoms, and medical treatment, however, did reduce HIV transmission in both groups. There is some evidence that nonoxynol-9 use may irritate or disrupt cells in the genital tract, making women more vulnerable to HIV infection. No mention is made in this report of the extent to which any of the subjects actually used the spermicide film."

        "abstract": "The most important risk of an unwanted pregnancy is induced abortion. Where abortion on demand is legal, the risk attached to an early induced abortion is minimal. Where it is illegal, as in most of South and Central America, the risk for a pregnant woman varies with her economic situation. The poorer the woman, the higher the risk. 2 approaches are used to estimate the number of illegal abortions: the use of hospital statistics for women hospitalized for complications of abortion and a inquiry into the obstetric history of a representative random sample of women of fertile age. The 1st strategy was mostly used in the 1960s, and the data were widely used to justify the use of contraceptives for the prevention of unwanted pregnancies. Although family planning programs, operated by both national governments and by the private sector, are now common in Latin America, all contraceptives have a certain proportion of failures, and some have side-effects which result in discontinuation of use. These factors, among others, help to maintain a high prevalence of illegal abortion. In Cuba, abortion was legalized in 1979 after a study showed that illegal abortions were the major cause of female death in the age group 15-44. Combined with contraceptive counseling, this has led Cuba to have a birth rate as low as Western European countries, and the lowest maternal and infant mortality rates in Latin America. In countries where abortion is illegal, the frequency of unwanted births in high. A study of 2485 pregnant women in a working class district of Santiago, Chile, showed only 33.1% of the women were happy with their pregnancy, 38.4% had mixed feelings, and 28.5% were unhappy. These children were followed up until they were 1 year old. More than 1 appointment at the well-baby clinic was missed by 12.2% of the mothers who had not wanted to be pregnant, as compared to 4.7% of mothers who had wanted to be pregnant. 19.8% of the unwanted children showed nutritional deficiencies at 1 year, while 12.7% of the wanted children did, 28.9% and 17.3% respectively, were undernourished. It is essential that the governments in Latin America increase their efforts to prevent unwanted pregnancies and to start seriously to think about changing their penal codes in order to legalize induced abortion."

The project offers a multi-year training program of health education designed to both fight the stigmatization of and violence against commercial sex workers and enhance their self-esteem, self-determination, and access to civil rights. The project therefore promotes individual awareness while influencing public opinion and policies. At first, health agents were recruited among women and transvestites who work in street-based sex work. The program was then gradually expanded to include young male sex workers and other locations, such as private parlors, saunas, and escort services. People of all sexes and sexual orientation now comprise the health agent group. The program has a paid staff of five women, three young men, and three transvestites, and approximately 70 sex workers are trained annually. Basic training includes topics such as human sexuality, personal risk assessment, HIV/STD infection, negotiation of safer sex, and STD referral services. Year two training emphasizes reproductive and women's health issues, while year three courses prioritize street work methodologies. Theatrical performances, speaking English as a second language, and performing Bach flower therapy for clients take place during the fourth year. Program trainers include medical specialists, nurses, psychologists, health educators, lawyers, and university students. At least half of the 350 health agents trained thus far are estimated to be currently engaged in paid or voluntary prevention work. Two surveys with female sex workers in 1991 and 1993 found that reported regular condom use increased from 57% to 73%; the health agents are having an effect. The program is constantly evaluated and revised."

        "abstract": "This article reviews the grim statistics of the worldwide AIDS epidemic and the worldwide tragedy of maternal mortality. It stresses that as much effort should be put into eliminating maternal mortality as has been put into eliminating AIDS. The perception that maternal mortality is natural and inevitable is hindering the introduction of modern contraceptives into some countries. AIDS makes men risk their lives for sex in the way that women have done throughout history and prehistory: AIDS is turning men into women when it comes to mortality statistics. Hopefully, this new situation will bring a new maturity to the public understanding of important public health issues, especially maternal mortality. The world as a whole must give more thought than it has in the past to the largely invisible plague of maternal mortality. In responding to AIDS and to maternal mortality, people must be helped to change their age-old patterns of sexual behavior and use contraceptives. By making men risk their lives for sex in the way that women always have, AIDS has the potential to make everyone more rational, more humane, and more concerned about fellow human beings."

        "abstract": "The salience of the Protection Motivation Theory to HIV preventive behavior was investigated in a sample of 468 heterosexual men 20-45 years of age recruited in Germany and at vacation spots in Spain. This theory conceptualizes self-protective behaviors as a function of the severity of the threat, perceived personal vulnerability to this threat, the availability of coping responses, and the effectiveness of these responses. Cognitive variables measured included perceived severity of the threat of AIDS, sexual self-efficacy expectancy, self-efficacy expectations in terms of sexual communication skills, response efficacy, and attitude toward condom use. On a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high), perceived severity of the AIDS threat averaged 5.3, individual susceptibility ratings averaged 3.5, and susceptibility of peers had a mean of 4.9. Although 33% of respondents had made behavioral changes in response to the AIDS epidemic, only 15% always used condoms while 12% used them occasionally. Self-efficacy expectancy with regard to assertiveness and use of preventive measures emerged as the most significant predictor of HIV-related behaviors. The causal analyses indicated that high communicative self-efficacy expectancy is associated with high-risk sexual behaviors, while self-efficacy expectancy regarding assertiveness and the use of preventive measures promotes risk reduction. These associations were strongest in men over 26 years of age, singles, and tourists. These findings suggest a need for interventions for couples such as assertiveness training and guidance on communicating about sex and AIDS. Also demonstrated was the need for AIDS education programs to identify where participants are in terms of perceiving the threat of and coping with the AIDS epidemic and promote conditions that will help people advance to the next stage."

The Be Proud] Be Responsible] AIDS Risk Reduction Program uses discussions of condom use, group participation, role plays, and other oral and written exercises to strive to increase STD/HIV/AIDS knowledge, improve self-pride, and promote safer sexual behaviors. The program entitled Human Sexuality--Values & Choices: A Values-Based Curriculum for 7th and 8th Grades promotes sexual abstinence and healthy social relationships through parent-child communication and a video-assisted format. The Reducing the Risk program is for high school students and aims to change student norms about unprotected sexual intercourse and perceptions of peer sexual activity and to strengthen parent-child communication on abstinence and contraception. The School/Community Program for Sexual Risk Reduction among Teens aims to motivate the entire community in preventing pregnancy among unmarried teens. Targeted training and workshops sites include public schools, universities, church groups, and civic organizations. It promotes abstinence as the preferred sexual health decision, but effective contraception for teens who become sexually active. Teen Talk is a collaborative school- and community health centers-based sexuality education intervention. It provides large group, lecture format presentations on reproductive physiology, contraceptive methods, and contraceptive effectiveness and various sessions (games, role plays, and trigger films encouraging group discussion)."

        "abstract": "Since simple quantitative measures of levels of infectious virus in blood, semen, and cervical secretions do not exist, the medical community does not yet understand the biological factors that determine both infectivity of and susceptibility to sexually transmitted HIV infection. A prospective study of female prostitutes and clients in Kenya shows that genital ulcer disease (GUD) especially chancroid was a very strong risk factor for HIV seroconversion (relative risk=4.7). The presence of a GUD also facilitated transmission. Yet a cohort study in Kinshasa, Zaire demonstrates that GUD prevalence was only 5% and of 55 women who seroconverted over 2 years, just 4 had a GUD before seroconversion. Another study of female prostitutes in Kinshasa finds that the nonulcerative sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) chlamydiasis, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis were also strongly related to HIV seroconversions (odds ratios=5, 3.5, and 1.9, respectively). Other research indicated that HIV infection influences STDs. For example, several case reports indicate that HIV infection causes more frequent progression to neurosyphilis, an atypical clinical presentation of syphilis, poor response to standard therapy, and high numbers of false negative and false positive serologic tests. These studies did not use a comparative HIV negative group, however. A study of 116 homosexual men shows a significantly greater mean number of recurrences of anal warts in HIV positive cases than HIV negative cases. A study in Kenya demonstrates a 4-fold higher incidence of gonococcal pelvic inflammatory disease in HIV positive prostitutes. These various results highlight the need to integrate STD prevention and control efforts with HIV control programs."

According to a health official working on the project, the project did so well in the first 4 months that the Health Ministry will expand the program nationally; this was due to begin in April 1999 in the province of Battambang. Cambodia is believed to have the highest HIV infection rate in Asia (50-70 persons/day). The HIV/AIDS Control Center estimates that 150,000 Cambodians (1.3% of the population) carry HIV; it is believed that 90% of those infected do not know that they have the disease. The flourishing sex industry and the low level of awareness concerning HIV are blamed for the rapid spread of the disease. About 20,000 women work in brothels; 42% of these women are estimated to be HIV positive.

        "abstract": "The mass media can be a powerful tool for teaching young people about the consequences of sexual activity. The HIV prevention media campaigns in Uganda have been instrumental in reducing HIV prevalence among young women in the 1990s. They produced a rise in monogamy, condom use in risky sexual relationships, and later age of sexual debut. Nevertheless, more research is needed to measure the influence of such campaigns on sexual behavior. In Uganda a nationwide campaign is promoting safer sex among adolescents, including abstinence, partner reduction, and condom use. Starting in 1995 the campaign by the Delivery of Improved Services for Health (DISH) Project, implemented by Pathfinder International and Johns Hopkins University, promoted HIV prevention messages through songs and soap operas, rap music contests, drama, and newsletters and posters. Eighty music groups performed songs about HIV prevention for target audiences 15-19 years old in 10 different districts. The winning song was recorded and distributed to taxi drivers and youth centers. In surveys of 1681 adolescents condom use among them increased from 46% before the campaign to 69% afterwards. The AIDS Information Center used radio announcements to promote HIV testing, with the result of young people turning up in large numbers. A 1993 survey of 6879 reproductive-age women also showed that about 13% of those who had seen the videos of songs 3 years earlier vs. only 4% of those who had not, were currently using contraception. Clinic locations, hotline telephone numbers, and referral networks can be included in mass media campaigns to enhance their effectiveness. If messages appear in different media simultaneously (music, television, radio, movies, and posters) the campaigns become even more effective. Focus group research and pretesting of materials help assess the effectiveness of materials before wide distribution."

The purpose of adolescent festivals is to increase communication between young people and their parents on subjects such as sexuality. Of particular concern is the traumatic emotional, physical, and financial impact of adolescent pregnancy, both in developed and developing countries. Contraceptive methods considered to be most appropriate for use in developing countries are injectable Depo-Provera and the Norplant contraceptive implant system. To reduce the problem of adolescent pregnancy, television programs need to portray responsible sexuality, family responsibility and involvement must be strengthended, funds for education and prevention programs should be increased, and there must be more intraprofessional collaboration. The World Federation of Contraception and Health, a nonprofit multicenter institution, has been created to make recommendations on how current resources can be utilized to address problems of adolescent sexuality. Adolescent clubs are being set up to provide adolescents and their families with computer support and information. Another concern is the spread of sexually transmitted diseases that cause infections in the genitourinary tract and threaten to impair future fertility. The incidence of diseases such as chlamydia trachomatis and nongonococcal urethritis is especially high in teenagers. Needed in the future are more multicenter studies conducted by microbiologists, pathophysiologists, family planning experts, epidemiologists, venereologists, gynecologists, obstetricians, and dermatologists on the many aspects of adolescent sexuality."

In Western society, the incidence of PID (annual) is 1% among women aged 15-34 years and 2% in the high risk group of women aged 15-24 years. The annual incidence in the US is higher, at least 2% among fecund sexually active women aged 13-44 years. The medical consequences of PID are infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. Causative agents include Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis and various other aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms; however, the natural genital flora of females is so varied that determining actual causative agents is difficult. some case-control studies have determined risk factors for PID; these include particularly current or prior use of IUD, prior pelvic surgery, sexual activity (including number of partners), race, and prior PID acute infection. PID is not a sexually transmitted disease, but rather is classified as sexually derived. Use of barrier methods and oral contraceptives protects against PID. IUD use greatly increases the risk of PID, probably because of the avenue the device provides for organisms to ascend from the lower to the upper genital tract. The role of males in PID etiology is currently the subject of much discussion. It is theorized that the mechanical action of penis insertion in intercourse helps to move causative agents to the upper genital region; also, semen may carry vaginal flora through the cervical opening into the uterus and tubes. Menstruation and PID are closely associated, perhaps because the cervix dilates during bleedings. Research areas include: determination of role of sexual activity (and number of partners) in PID etiology; evaluation of events of menstruation that are predisposing; evaluation of relationship between bacteriosperma and lower and upper genital infections; relationship of particular contraceptive methods to PID incidence; and breakdown of risk factors."

Both HIV-positive and HIV-negative women are WASN members. Women have limited control over sexual relationships. Women who know their partners are having intercourse with other women have few options, e.g., they may depend on their partners. A family council settles marital disagreements, but husbands do not always cooperate. Increased peer pressure could change societal acceptance of male infidelity to positive attitudes toward friendship and partnership in marriage. Therefore, WASN explores sexual relationships, especially control and power in them. These discussions should lead to affirmation of positive behavior. For example, men can promote condom use and monogamy to their male peers. They can also talk to their partners and their sons about HIV. Rural women should not blame urban women for their partner's HIV status. WASN also targets schoolgirls. Most early and some current messages of AIDS campaigns reinforces the dichotomy of good and bad women, supported by an earlier link between urban women and sexually transmitted diseases. Yet, they ignored men's role in HIV transmission. WASN speaks out against such negative images, e.g., dramas that depict the HIV-infected woman as evil and the innocent as good while the man worries about which woman infected him instead of feeling awful about infecting other women. WASN also addressee AIDS-related discrimination on the job and stigmatization issues. It now is conducting 2 research projects: information needs of urban and rural women and capacities of family support systems to assist HIV-positive women."

        "abstract": "New options for HIV and AIDS education assume that people make decisions based on their assessment of level of risk and that their actions are dependent on their ability to change the situation and their feelings, values, and needs. Safe sex practices, including the use of condoms, provide more choices for people than sexual abstinence, staying with one sexual partner, or having sex with fewer partners. Condom use also helps prevent unwanted pregnancy. Some options for practicing safer sex include nonpenetrative sex or penetrative sex with a condom. Oral sex is less risky than unprotected penetrative vaginal or anal sex, but this should be avoided if there are sores on the genitals, mouth, or lips. When a condom is used with oral sex, or a piece of latex is placed over a woman's genitals, risk is further reduced. Safer sex is an activity that prevents semen, vaginal fluids, and blood from entering another person's body or coming into contact with broken skin. Safe sex options should be presented in a positive manner which encourages people to explore what methods would be comfortable to use with their partners. The topic of why people do not use condoms can be introduced at an appropriate time in a general discussion of the benefits of safer sex. Some benefits include protection against HIV, sexually transmitted diseases, and pregnancy and a reduction in the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and cervical cancer among women. Safer sex has no side effects, and the tight fit of a condom for some men helps maintain an erection. The important consideration in condoms is proper use. Practice reduces the chances of breakage. Groups can practice on a model penis made of wood, rubber, or clay. Proper storage of condoms is required for effectiveness. A cool, dark, dry place is needed. Condoms should not be used when brittle or sticky, or after an expiration date. A woman's arousal and release of lubricants assures ease of penetration and reduction in the chances of condom breakage. Use of vaseline or butter damages condoms. Condom use instructions are provided."

Individual interviews assessing the prostitutes' knowledge of AIDS were conducted in dance halls, night clubs, and bars; the prostitutes were categorized on the basis of socio-economic and demographic criteria. 70% used condoms on a regular basis.

The prevalence of HIV-1 was significantly higher among women (6.5%) than among men (1.7%). HIV infection rates were also higher among women than among men in all areas except rural villages. Transmission dynamics were not fully assessed in this study. The prevalence of HIV-1 among divorced and separated individuals was 14.8%; among married and cohabiting individuals, it was 4%. Significantly more persons with multiple sexual partners used condoms regularly (19.3%) than persons with 1 partner (6.4%)."

        "abstract": "Prevailing law and church dictum in 1989 Poland precluded talking about condoms and sex on the radio. Accordingly, a young woman who did a radio-theater drama with some friends about how to avoid HIV infection was thrown out of school. This youth, however, knew that her audience found the emission to be provocative and interesting, and that people were having unprotected sex at concerts in toilet stalls with unknown partners. The Ministry of Health nonetheless said funds were unavailable for condom distribution. Undeterred, the author, her younger brother, and 2 friends joined forces to make large banners with pictures of condoms, bought 500 condoms with their own money, and went to the largest rock festival in Warsaw. She described on stage what AIDS is and how to contract it while friends handed out condoms and leaflets. Their success how has them cooperating with 20 other groups and going to concerts to talk about AIDS and hand out condoms. They have also sprayed graffiti across Warsaw aimed at preventing HIV transmission and provide leaflets and condoms with money from France to ticket holders at area clubs; letters requesting cooperative action have been received. Despite the success of these activities, the Ministry of Health requires receipt of a project and budget proposal before they may consider funding. Graffiti, however, is illegal in Poland and the new Catholic government made is impossible to obtain cheap Polish condoms in shops. The activists continued to develop banners and graffiti, but failed to keep people from engaging in high risk sex with multiple partners. 3 of the author's attractive and healthy female friends therefore began going to concerts and night clubs where they feigned soliciting sexual relations and being HIV-seropositive. Unsuspecting takers without condoms were informed of the girls contrived HIV serostatus and told they must surely desire death if they are ready to have unprotected intercourse. The desire to use condoms has increased markedly in these clubs over the 6 months since the adoption of this latter approach. The author and her associates have helped to get young people thinking about using condoms despite the prevailing laws, mortality and church. Polish condoms are now easier to secure since the installation of the new government. In sum, the author stresses the importance communication between people of closed subcultures."

The highest seroprevalences for all of the STDs, except HIV, were observed in the 26-35 year old age group for both men and women. The highest incidences of HIV were among men aged 26-35 (41.6%) and women aged 16-25 years (55.5%). There was a significantly higher incidence of viral STDs than of bacterial STDs. The association of HIV infection with the 4 STDs is described. A higher incidence of STDs, including HIV, was observed in association with ulcers and genital warts. Demographic characteristics and HIV risk factors for men and women are presented. Viral isolations found a positive percentage of 19.00 and 14.00 for HSV II and CMV, respectively."

The TA approach focuses upon teaching adults how to abandon self-defeating strategies, typically learned during childhood, and how to develop attitudes for managing life's problems.

        "abstract": "In vitro studies indicate that an intact female condom effectively prevents sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV infection, remains impermeable during intercourse, and is more leak resistant than the male latex condom. Most trials in 30 countries show that, with practice, women can easily insert the condom. Women not bothered by touching their genitals and who have experience with male condoms or insertion of objects (e.g., diaphragms) into the vagina report fewer problems with insertion. The rings of the female condom appear to bother both women and their partners. The inner ring caused 30% of women in Thailand to stop using it. 20% of males did not like their penises touching the ring. Prostitutes in France and their patrons removed the inner ring and used it like a male condom. Mexican prostitutes objected to its overly large size, fearing that penises that large would not go into their vaginas. Other users did not like its baggy appearance. Some Mexican women did not like the outer ring being outside the vagina, but after experience, they considered it to be positive since it provides protection and is hygienic. Some infrequent complaints include noisiness, labial itching, and irritation. Sexual pleasure seems to increase with use. More than 50% of trial participants and partners considered the female condom to be acceptable and would use it again. Prostitutes in Mexico and Cameroon were very pleased, mainly because the female condom can protect them against HIV and STDs. Low-income prostitutes and their clients in Thailand appreciated it. Men in developing countries tended to dislike it more than those in developed countries. The female condom will be available for women in the US and in Europe in 1993. It is relatively expensive, and the price should be reduced."

The needs an well-being of people, especially girls, in this age group in India, however, are neglected. Almost 25% of India's population is comprised of girls below 20 years of age. Adolescent pregnancies make up 10-15% of the total and may be largely attributed to early marriage, but these girls are prepared neither physically nor emotionally for pregnancy and motherhood. Adolescents who marry between aged 15-19 will nonetheless bear on average 6-7 children over the course of their lives. In fact, 80% of women's time between the ages 15 and 35 is spent either being pregnant or nursing offspring. Sections discuss nutritional deprivation and poor fetal growth, obstetric risks, and maternal and infant mortality, literacy and school dropouts, and psychosocial aspects of adolescent pregnancy and motherhood. Intervention programs could aim to increase total food intake, prevent against iron deficiency anemia, provide education and health care for girls aged 10-15, promote the use of contraception, register marriages and provide family life education, and involve boys in the education process. While the marriage age needs to be increased, this change should not be legislated. Change must instead result from education syllabi at the school level."

Socially apart youth are especially vulnerable to HIV/STDs because of their need to fulfill immediate survival needs, residents in tourist areas or places controlled by drug trafficking, a lack of housing and secure sleeping place, a high incidence of STDs and lack of access to treatment, forced mobility, and social prejudice and institutional barriers. Government agencies and nongovernmental organizations must integrate their efforts to reduce the impact of HIV/STDs and AIDS upon this population. Suggestions are offered.

The program educates prostitutes about AIDS and the expected protective benefits of condom and spermicide use. Natural leaders are identified among groups of prostitutes and trained to be health educators for other prostitutes. The program supplies the educators with both condoms and vaginal spermicidal tablets. The health educators keep track of the women's use of the supplies to allow measures of behavioral change that might serve to slow AIDS transmission. In preparing for the Ghana program, prostitutes were tested for HIV and interviewed about their knowledge of AIDS and precautions they were taking against it and other sexually transmitted diseases. The interviews revealed that the prostitutes were aware of AIDS and very fearful, but they lacked accurate information about AIDS, ways to reduce personal risks and risks to customers, and access to services that might assist them. The Ghana study, which will last for 6 months and involve 8 health educators working with 100 other prostitutes, is funded by the American Foundation for AIDS Research. FHI is considering the feasibility of similar interventions in other African, Asian, Latin American countries, and the US."

        "abstract": "A survey conducted in Zimbabwe in 1997 sought to identify the key socioeconomic, demographic, and psychographic determinants of high-risk sexual practices in a national sample of 1987 adult men and women. Specifically, the study developed profiles of the types of persons who were most likely to have more than one sexual partner without using a condom in the 6-12 weeks before the survey, least likely to have used condoms with casual partners, and least likely to have used condoms with steady partners. The factors with the strongest associations with these three indicators of risky sexual practices were excessive consumption of alcohol, history of a sexually transmitted disease (STD), and embarrassment in acquiring condoms. Those who believed that condom users are more likely than nonusers to have an STD were less likely to use condoms, as were respondents who thought it is easy to tell if someone has HIV/AIDS. A significant proportion of respondents felt that condom use with a regular partner or spouse amounts to distrust and indicates adultery. These psychographic factors, which were more salient than any demographic or socioeconomic factors, will be used to identify potential targets for condom marketing in Zimbabwe. For example, IEC campaigns are being designed to communicate that alcohol users have a higher risk of HIV/STDs, that familiarity with condoms engenders trust, and that condom purchase should not be a source of embarrassment."

TAMPEP uses cultural mediators and peer educators and also offers prostitutes seminars, workshops, and other field activities to empower them and create an environment that supports safer sex behavior. Because sex workers migrate, new peer educators are continuously trained. The most successful peer educators are leaders of their target group; exhibit some knowledge of health, educational talents, and excellent communication skills; and are highly ambitious and motivated. TAMPEP spends 2-3 months selecting, training, and following-up peer educators. Peer educators receive a small fee while undergoing training, and they participate in course design. The peer educators receive a certificate upon completion of the course. Cultural mediators conduct follow-up by supporting the peer educators as they assume their new role, providing additional information and materials, and facilitating contacts with public health personnel. Lessons learned the program's first five years reveal that peer education programs should: 1) be part of a broader effort to improve conditions for migrant sex workers, 2) be conducted by autonomous community-based organizations, and 3) continuously adapt to change."

A random sample of 283 Hispanic men and women seeking services at a public STD clinic in New York City were surveyed in an examination of differences in their attitudinal patterns, normative beliefs, and practices related to condom use with primary and nonprimary sex partners. 60% of the participants were male. The group was of mean age 30.9 years, with 46% having graduated from high school. 44.5% were born in the US, although 73.8% had lived in mainland US for the previous ten years or longer. 52.7% were single, 19.8% married, and the remaining 27.5% were either divorced, separated, or widowed. Only 3.2% of men and women reported having same-sex relationships, although the authors suggest that the respondents may have underreported the extent of their bisexual and homosexual behavior. 58.3% of men and 53.3% of women reported having had a prior STD, 82.2% of men and 74.8% of women had experience using a condom, and 31.3% of men and 13.3% of women reported having nonprimary partners. Both the men and women report that they are more likely to use condoms in nonprimary than primary relationships and that they perceive fewer barriers to doing so. Issues related to trust and social acceptability are more salient in primary relationships. Interventions to promote condom use among Hispanics must acknowledge the different psychosocial influences upon condom use in different relationships and target the specific attitudinal and behavioral changes desired."

Withdrawal is also used: 10.0% and 7.4% respectively. Condom use was correlated with being older at 1st intercourse, having a higher educational level, closer association to partner, and sense of male contraceptive responsibility. The data used for this analysis was taken from a sub-sample of 624 sexually active males in 1979. The mean age at 1st intercourse was 14.8 years and mean age at most recent was 18.9 years. The pill was also used at 1st intercourse (8.8%) and a total of 43.5% used some method of contraception. In the most recent intercourse cases, 64.7% used some method of birth control and the pill was used 26.5% , condom 15.5%, and withdrawal 7.4%. Conclusions from this data indicate that male methods are important in teen contraception. Condom use at 1st and most recent intercourse was related to both positive and negative characteristics. It appears that males show some contraceptive responsibility initially but later give the responsibility to females. The declining use of condoms indicates it to be a transitional form of birth control. Programs should promote continued use of condoms since use of the pill is low and unwanted pregnancy risk is high. Communication on contraception should be encouraged, so both partners are aware if neither one is contracepting. With the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic, condom use takes on a whole new context in relation to the decline in use by adolescents."

        "abstract": "Most sex work research examines the impact of HIV on prostitutes and on society and involves testing prostitutes for HIV antibodies, but it does not examine the role of others in the sex industry. Sex industry workers include female prostitutes, transvestites, transsexuals, and male prostitutes, bar and brothel owners, taxi drivers, sex workers' partners, and sex business managers. Since sex workers provide sexual services to clients, they are in a perfect position to teach them about sexual health. Society must recognize that we cannot wish the sex industry away and that we need an effective health promotion strategy now. Some successful relevant AIDS education campaigns provide us some guidelines on how to develop campaigns. Any campaign targeting the sex industry should also target the public. Sex workers should participate in developing health messages and educational activities. They should also participate in the project. Any campaign must deal with major obstacles to safer sexual practices of which sex workers are aware and be consulted. Common obstacles are client demand for unprotected sex and irregular and inadequate supply of inexpensive condoms. A health promotion strategy cannot be effective, however, if sex workers do not have access to social support and health care services. Health promotion workers should also encourage local authorities to end discrimination of sex workers so they can freely obtain needed services. In some countries, sex workers operate fantasy workshops providing peers with ideas to sell sex services which reduce the risk of HIV transmission. Other campaigns distribute safer sex messages on small cards, cigarette lighters, key rings, condom packages, and T shirts. Training of sex workers other than prostitutes to reinforce safer sex messages to clients is also effective, e.g., taxi drivers can say they will take a client to a woman who uses condoms rather than to a clean girl. Street theater and puppets have also successfully disseminated safer sex messages."

The number of new cases is expected to nearly double every year, and deaths from AIDS may come to exceed deaths from diarrhea and all other infectious diseases. Since 1985, all donated blood has been screened. A national education campaign began in 1985, using television, talks, workshops, and pamphlets, and coordinated by the National AIDS Commission. AIDS education is included in secondary and high school curricula, and condoms have been distributed in gay discotheques and other public places since 1987.

When sex partners do not initially agree upon condom use, influence strategies may be used to persuade one to either use or not use condoms. The authors examined the opinions and experiences of 393 college students with condom power strategies. Participants were recruited from introductory psychology courses at UCLA and were of mean age 19 years. Overall, they gender-typed strategies as feminine when the goal was to persuade a partner to use condoms and masculine when trying to avoid condom use. Effectiveness and comfort ratings of the strategies varied by student gender and tactic being evaluated. Gender differences were also noted in students' actual experiences with the strategies. Men used seduction most often when trying to encourage condom use, while women most often withheld sex. To encourage avoiding condom use, men were more likely than women to use seduction, reward, and information."

Although no comprehensive data on rate of HIV infection in South Africa exists, one study suggests that the rate of infection is doubling every 8.5 months. Initially a disease among white male gay community, HIV has now begun to spread among the black heterosexual population. One estimate indicates that the number of HIV-positive blacks ranges somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 million people. Some believe that the current massive tuberculosis epidemic currently affecting the black population is related to the AIDS epidemic. What little the government has done to combat AIDS has been ineffective. The gay community has been shunned. And as AIDS has spread through the black community, the government has done little more than dispense free condoms through family planning clinics. But these clinics are distrusted by blacks, since the government's family planning program has attempted to limit the growth of the black population while encouraging the growth of the white population. Only the community- based health sector possess the political credibility necessary to lead the fight against AIDS. The National Progressive Primary Health Care Network has begun devising an AIDS prevention strategy. Regional AIDS committees have begun disseminating information and training community health workers. The author notes that a determined campaign will be needed to end the association of condoms with the government's racist family planning policy. Although South Africa currently faces political turmoil, the author fears that AIDS could turn out to be the bigger threat."

A study in Korea of male students and industrial workers found that while 96-99% knew that AIDS can be transmitted through sexual intercourse with an infected person and over 90% knew that condoms can prevent pregnancy and the transmission of STDs, only 39-48% of those sexually experienced reported using a condom during their most recent episode of sexual intercourse. Of those who were sexually experienced, 80% of industrial workers and 73% of students reported having had sex with a prostitute. Almost all sampled adolescents in Guatemala had heard of AIDS, but the young men reported only sporadic condom use.

The discussions focused upon knowledge about the transmission of AIDS and prevention, attitudes toward AIDS and people with AIDS, and sexual and other behaviors related to AIDS risk. Each group comprised 8-10 boys, each person remaining anonymous except for providing his age and a first name to use in the group discussions. All but two participants had heard of AIDS and knew that it was incurable and sexually transmitted. 93% endorsed the idea that condoms can prevent infection, but all were overwhelmingly negative about condom use and people with AIDS. None had heard of HIV and none were able to specify sperm and blood as the media for transmission. Vulnerability to AIDS was attributed to casual sex and sex with particular groups of people, but not to the act of unprotected penetrative sex. 68% were certain that they could not get AIDS from someone who looks healthy. The boys harbored other misinformation on how one may contract AIDS. All agreed that selling sex, to both men and women, is the best way to get money on the streets. They reported earning R10-200 per day depending upon the city, the customer's gender, and other circumstances. Their clients usually insisted upon unprotected penetrative oral, anal, or vaginal sex. They also engaged in survival sex to enlist or mollify powerful others, in exchange for protection, accommodation, or other goods and services; had sex with their girlfriends, many of whom also work as prostitutes; and commonly used alcohol and other drugs. Once intoxicated, the boys are more likely to have risky sex; their vulnerability to being raped also increases. These youths are neither more nor less informed or misinformed about the transmission of AIDS than their counterparts in other countries. Information alone, however, is unlikely to induce behavior change. Study results are discussed in terms of their implications for intervention and the inadequacies of the Health Belief Model and related theories as the sole theoretical foundation for the design of intervention programs."

The theme was, \"Can the abortion rate be changed?\" The number of abortions rose from 19,919 in 1985 to 21,199 in 1988, a rate of 6%. The previous 8 years had shown a steady decrease from 25,662 in 1977. This was especially pronounced in women under 25. The birth rate climbed 10% at the same time. With the exception of Ireland, free access to abortion is the rule in the majority of the countries of Europe. Prenatal diagnosis (PD)--chorionic villus biopsies and amniocentesis--was begun in 1970 in Denmark. Investigation of placental biopsies was begun in 1983. The number of diagnoses rose sharply after this. From 1980-1988 the number of legally induced abortions was between 20,000 and 23,000. The number of spontaneous abortions rose from 8000 to over 9000. There were approximately 70 abortions because of PD. This figure reached 133 in 1980. Women aged 35 and above have made increasing use of PD. After PD was brought about, the number of legal abortions dropped. 42% of pregnant women over 35 carried to term;l 46% chose legal abortion. In the 40-year age group, the figures were 23% and 60%, respectively. Data on 140 abortion seekers (AS) (ages 16-21) in Denmark (73.6% replied) were compared to 201 sexually active youngsters who were not pregnant. The abortion seekers showed no difference from those not pregnant. However, more among the AS had started sexual intercourse with the 1st 2 years after menarche; they had had many different sexual partners. 73.9% of the AS used contraception at 1st intercourse, compared to 82.1% of those not pregnant. In the abortion-seeking group, about 1/3 became pregnant despite the use of contraception (generally a condom). 44% had most recently used a pill. In 1973, a law was passed permitting abortion before the end of the 12th week of pregnancy. In the last 17 years, abortions have become more frequent among young career women. The average age at 1st pregnancy is in the late 20s."

        "abstract": "By January 1992, almost 450,000 AIDS cases had been reported to the Global Program on AIDS of the World Health Organization (GPA/WHO), but the estimated number of adult cases was 1.5 million based on about 1000 available HIV serological survey data and HIV data bases. 2 million people in the Americas, 1/2 million in Western Europe, over 6.5 million in Sub=Saharan Africa, and 1 million in South and Southeast Asia have been infected since the pandemic started. In North America and Western Europe, the incidence has been declining since the mid-1980s (50,000 cases/year in the US, several times more in the early 1980s). During 1991 in sub=Saharan Africa, 200,000 adult AIDS cases occurred in accordance with the 10-years latency of the disease. The estimated figures of HIV infection as of early 1992 were 5-7 million men and 3-5 million women with 1.5 million full-blown AIDS cases, 90% of whom have died. In sub-Saharan Africa, 1 out of 3 children born to infected mothers become infected, and almost 1 million infected children have been born in the world since the pandemic started. The peak incidence of AIDS cases is expected in the mid-1990s in developed countries because of high HIV infection rate in the early 1980s. A steady increase of heterosexual transmission is projected depending on the effectiveness of HIV/AIDS prevention programs. In developing countries, AIDS cases and attendant mortality are expected to increase substantially in the 1990s and beyond with AIDS becoming the leading cause of death among adults in productive life. In sub-Saharan African cities, HIV seropositivity may range from under 10% to 30% in the 15-49 age group. The improvement of surveillance and estimation methods of HIV/AIDS prevalence is a prerequisite of AIDS programs of health care systems."

        "abstract": "A recent conference on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the Americas, held in Quito, Ecuador, and organized by PAHO, showed that most governments have accepted the gravity of the situation and the need for action in Latin America and the Caribbean. The conference supplied up-to-date information for scientists, health workers and policy markers, as well as helping to educate the general public, and it allowed people from all over the region to ask questions on research, drugs, health care, and related subjects. The AIDS pattern in the region appears similar to the 1st stage in developed countries, involving a high % of homosexual and bisexual men. Few female cases have been reported in Latin American nations, but in the Caribbean, where AIDS prevalence is much higher, more women are affected. Blood transfusions are a major source of infection in Latin America, and most countries do not have the equipment or organization needed to test all donors. Overall, Latin American data are still far too fragmentary for accurate forecasting, but 1 indicator at least shows that people are heeding educational efforts: condom sales in Brazil increased by nearly 50% during 1986, while street sellers in Bogota say AIDS has done wonders for their condom business."

        "abstract": "In 1986, 337 Dutch youths aged 15-19 were asked to complete a questionnaire on their sexual and contraceptive behavior, their behavior with respect to AIDS prevention, and the sex education they had received. Of those who completed the questionnaire, 42% of the men and 33% of the women had experienced sexual intercourse. 71% of the men and 65% of the women who had experienced sexual intercourse expected to do so on their first episode, while 50% of the women had explicitly discussed it with their boyfriends beforehand. More than 70% used effective contraception at first intercourse, with 40% using condoms, 20% using the pill, and almost 10% combining both methods. At most recent intercourse, 85% used the pill and/or condoms. While 50% of the sexually active teens reported having always used contraception, 10% had had sexual intercourse more than five times without contraceptive protection. Further, 43% of boys compared to 15% of girls reported either initiating condom use or using condoms more regularly to protect themselves against HIV infection. 75% of the teens received sex education from one or both parents, although boys tended to be comparatively more neglected in this regard by their parents than girls. The central element of the three-year study on the sexual and contraceptive behavior of adolescents was, however, a qualitative comparison between the sexual lifestyles and interaction skills of 39 girls who visited a family planning clinic to obtain contraception and 34 girls who visited a clinic for an abortion. The abortion clients were less effective contraceptors than the girls from the other group, while the effectiveness of contraceptive use was more permanent in the family planning clinic group. While family planning seekers view contraception as a functional tool to prevent unwanted pregnancies, abortion seekers were more preoccupied by the sexual aspect of contraception rather than by its original function such that sex seemed to be less self-evident for the abortion clients than for the girls from the family planning clinic. Furthermore, abortion clients were less active than contraception seekers during precoital negotiation with their sex partners, and had comparatively less control over what happened during sexual contacts. The author stresses that sex education programs must educate young audiences, but also explicitly focus upon the possibilities of changes in attitude and behavior, negotiation skills, and the need for equal responsibility among sex partners about what happens during intercourse."

        "abstract": "Although abortion in Uganda is illegal and permitted only to save the life of the mother, both spontaneous and induced abortion remains a major health problem in the country. Over the years, abortion has contributed largely to a high maternal mortality and morbidity rate (550/100,000 live births). A study conducted in 3 hospitals in Kampala recorded 3132 cases of induced abortion in 13 months; 420 were certainly induced abortions, 28 of which resulted in maternal death. In spite of the high fertility rate, contraceptive prevalence remains low in the country, resulting in high rates of teenage pregnancy. Generally single, young, and low-parity women, most often secondary school and university students, account for the bulk of all induced abortions. Most common reasons for termination of pregnancy include a desire to continue education and parental fear. The leading complications resulting from induced abortions were sepsis, hemorrhage, and genital tract trauma."

        "abstract": "School girls, teachers, and health school students were surveyed, using 3 different questionnaires, in January 1993. Catherine Payne, former research associate of the Family Planning Council of Southeastern Pennsylvania, visited Bhutan from August 18 through September 4, 1993, to assist with the interpretation of results and to interview teachers in schools where the new curriculum would be introduced and officials who were writing it. Results were released in October 1993. 160 young women (10-20 years of age) from 5 schools were surveyed and another 60 were interviewed by Payne. 25% of the surveyed girls understood the connection between menstruation and reproduction. Of those who had heard of menstruation, 60% had heard about it from their friends; 30%, from siblings; 27%, from mothers; and 10%, from schools. Teachers in the survey were supportive of the study and recognized the importance of reproductive health education. Also, officials of the education and health ministries, epidemiologists, experts in information, education, and communication (IEC), and district health officers attended a 2-day workshop directed at local data collection and analysis of this type. Although teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are increasing in Bhutan, family planning services are not reaching youth, particularly those who do not attend school or do not have children. Hospitals provide contraceptives mainly to those over 21, and outreach clinics are not catering to the family planning needs of minors. One of the recommendations of this survey/workshop was to provide correct information on reproductive health to youth."

The findings show that migrant couples have a much higher HIV discordance and prevalence than nonmigrant couples. However, according to the findings, only women were HIV positive, while their migrant partners were HIV negative. Thus, all migrants and their partners were treated for STI and given health education.

        "abstract": "The findings of a survey conducted among 4510 young men and women 15-24 years old in six districts of Uganda revealed a need for more comprehensive reproductive health services for adolescents and earlier introduction of sex education. By age 15 years, 52% of males and 38% of females were already sexually active. In the three years preceding the survey, 45.3% of males and 13.4% of females had had three or more sexual partners. Although 78.2% of males and 56.6% of females had heard of condoms, only 12.7% of males and 0.4% of females reported current condom use. The overwhelming majority (83.9% of males and 87.0% of females) were not using any contraceptive method and there was widespread agreement that condom use communicates a lack of respect for one's partner. Awareness of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)--especially acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, syphilis, and gonorrhea--was high, and 21.4% of males and 7.8% of females admitted to a history of at least one STD. Earlier initiation of sex education in the school curriculum might increase awareness of the importance of condom use before young people become sexually active and thus help to close the gap between knowledge and practice. Also urged are reproductive health care services for adolescents that integrate sex education, STD diagnosis and treatment, and family planning."

Hospital and community health care of AIDs patients should integrate education, counseling, clinical, nursing, laboratory, pastoral care and administration. Decentralization of primary health car into the wider community is achieved in this way. The ultimate result of community care is re-education of the family and the community so that behavioral change in patterns of sexual intercourse occurs. At Chikankata Hospital the average length of stay of HIV patients has fallen from 32 days in 1987 to 16.2 days in 1988. Numbers of home care patients have increased, as 80% prefer home visits, and most people prefer to die at home. As an example of the powerful effect of community counseling as a result of home care, people are deciding to take action on the issue of ritual cleansing by sexual intercourse, to re-introduce traditional taboos and family authority, and to discuss the effect of alcohol on AIDS. Chikankata Hospital has also started training programs for AIDS health workers from the region, and for local volunteers. Transferable management concepts include the term \"normalization\" which implies that AIDS is here to stay and future generations must be protected by permanent change in behavior."

        "abstract": "A new look at data from the Women's Health Study, done in 1976-1978, focuses on the outcomes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and its determinants, and ectopic pregnancy, in IUD users. The advantage of this data set is that it does not suffer from bias resulting from the bad publicity that IUDs have since received. 657 cases of PID ascertained by discharge diagnosis were compared to 2566 sexually active controls with non-gynecological conditions. The overall data showed that the Dalkon shield conferred a relative risk of 8.3, and the risk was slightly elevated for Progestasert and Copper-7, compared to women using no method of contraception. Broken down by duration of use, most of the risk was limited to the 1st 4 months of use, and the highest risk was in the 1st month, 3.8. Regarding aspects of sexual behavior, the risks were computed for women claiming only one sexual partner. Single and previously married women had about twice the risk of married or cohabiting women. It is likely that this can be explained by a higher proportion of women whose partners were monogamous among married and cohabiting women, than among single or divorced women. The risk of ectopic pregnancy was 0.4 for IUD and traditional method users, and 0.1 for pill users, compared to non-contracepting women. Thus IUDs put women at a slightly higher risk of ectopic pregnancy, but at a low absolute risk, since they lower the overall change of pregnancy."

This relatively and absolutely high prevalence of HIV infection in the Eastern Region is closely related to the emigration of women to Cote d'Ivoire for work as prostitutes, and their ultimate return to their home villages in Eastern Ghana. It is hypothesized that the construction of the Volta river dam at Akosombe in the 1960s led to the establishment of a prostitution industry in that region. After the work was completed, the female prostitutes from Ghana followed the construction workers to their next site in Koussou, Cote d'Ivoire, and later moved to Abidjan. By 1990, an estimated 60% of the prostitutes in Abidjan were Ghanaian, one third of whom were from the Eastern Region. The national AIDS program of Cote d'Ivoire reported in 1992 that 86% of prostitutes in Abidjan were infected with HIV. Since 1986, these women have been returning to their villages in Ghana's Eastern Region to live out the last few months of their lives. Ghanaians are aware of this phenomenon and generally believe that HIV and AIDS affect only prostitutes from Abidjan. That, however, is not the case. The national AIDS program estimates that 2% of the adult population in the country is infected with HIV, mainly through sex with a Ghanaian in Ghana who is not a prostitute. All sexually active individuals in Ghana may therefore be at risk of contracting and transmitting HIV. This message must be communicated to the general public."

        "abstract": "The Association of Reproductive Health Professionals hosted its annual meeting entitled \"Reproductive Health ¿94: The Continuing Challenge\" in October 1994 in Atlanta. Specialists in the fields of family planning and sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention are interested in integrating the two services. Many family planning clinics already screen for STDs, yet few STD clinics offer family planning services. The health care emphasis for STDs is crisis (symptomatic), while it is preventive (asymptomatic) for family planning. Nonuse and misuse of contraception contribute to unintended pregnancy. Health providers should emphasize the need to reduce periods of contraceptive nonuse and misuse among women. We must pay more attention to implementing effective adolescent pregnancy prevention programs. Women need information, awareness of social influences and pressures, and practical skills to deal with these influences and pressures. The CDC collects retrospective surveillance data on persons with AIDS who have worked in a health care or clinical laboratory setting, maintains a voluntary surveillance system on case reports of occupationally acquired AIDS/HIV infection, and evaluates prospective studies of health care workers exposed to HIV. There have been 40 cases of documented occupationally acquired AIDS/HIV infection and 83 possible cases. The risk of acquiring HIV after one needlestick is less than 0.3%. Universal precautions reduce the risk of occupational transmission of HIV. A risk analysis algorithm helps physicians determine the risk of a contraceptive for women with a medical problem (e.g., metastatic breast cancer); it considers the following: risk of method with disease; risk of pregnancy with disease; probability patient will accept another method and use it effectively; and method's effectiveness. Almost all women can use hormonal contraceptive methods."

        "abstract": "Child and adult mortality increases in Cameroon due to AIDS will cause life expectancy to fall by as many as 8 years, from just over 50 to just over 40 years. The social consequences of AIDS include grieving, stigmatizing, and the large-scale disruption of family and community structures. Widows and widowers due to AIDS mortality are affected differently from each other, with the widows of men who have died from AIDS facing potential sociocultural and economic hardship. The economic consequences of AIDS in Bamenda and elsewhere in Cameroon will occur mainly through the epidemic's impact upon the size and quality of the labor force. By killing a significant number of male and female workers aged 15-60 years, AIDS will reduce the size and growth rate of the labor force. Despite, rapid population growth, labor is a relatively scarce factor of agricultural production in Cameroon. The spread of HIV in rural areas, combined with the intensity and scarcity of agricultural labor, suggests that AIDS will have an impact upon production and per capita incomes, and increase the already high rates of hunger and absolute poverty. In the context of HIV/AIDS, young people must be empowered to make informed decisions about sex. Adolescents are most at risk because they tend to experiment more than married couples and have many sex partners. Sexual activity begins as early as age 8 years and penetrative sex at age 13 or earlier. The author considers the factors which encourage adolescents to engage in sexual activities."

These variables are assumed to be dependent on parity as well as family size. The model is used to measure the percentage reduction in total fertility when several vertical family planning programs are in operation. Under the various program combinations, the proportions of females according to number of births during the 1st 30 years of marriage, average family size, and percentage reduction in number of births are calculated. The fertility reduction is higher among women with smaller family size desires, regardless of family planning program effort. The data further indicate that a higher reduction in total fertility can be attained through sterilization than through the use of highly effective contraception."

In those who practiced anal intercourse, there was also concomitant condom use reported by 71% of homosexual men, 53% of bisexual men, 16% of heterosexual men, and 7% of heterosexual women. Those most likely to use condoms were homosexual men, prostitutes, those who had multiple partners, and those with an HIV-infected partner. Those least likely to use condoms were heterosexual men and women. While significant changes in sexual practice appear to have been made in the homosexual community, heterosexuals who practice anal intercourse have not made many changes. More explicit AIDS education may be necessary which acknowledges that anal intercourse is practiced by heterosexuals and which advises condom use accordingly."

Age at 1st intercourse was 18 years. Men were more likely to have ever masturbated than women (80% vs. 58.4%; p=.0001). 1st masturbation occurred around age 14, but the period between 1st masturbation and 1st intercourse was shorter for women than men. Men reached orgasm more often than women (98.9% vs. 84.2%; p=.0001). Women were more likely to have had their 1st intercourse with a steady partner (66.1% vs. 43.5%; p=.001).

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 8 million people have become infected with HIV since the early 1980s. As of November 1990, WHO estimates that some 800,000 people have developed AIDS. 54% of the HIV infections have occurred in Africa, 35% in the Americas, and 8% in Western Europe. The main HIV transmission routes are: 1) sexual intercourse with an infected partner (accounting for 75% of all infections); 2) HIV-infected blood or blood products, which include blood transfusions (5%), IV drug use (10%), and other needle (0.1%); and 3) perinatal transmission from infected mother to infant (10%). The article describes the 3 patterns of HIV infection so far: 1) In industrialized countries and in Latin America, HIV infections appeared in the early 1980s among homosexual men or IV drug users and then spread to the heterosexual population; 2) In Eastern and Central Africa, where heterosexual sex has been the main transmission route, infections began in the late 1970s; 3) In the rest of the world, HIV was not introduced until the mid-1980s, and because of the low prevalence rate, the main transmission route has not yet been determined. By the year 2000, WHO expects some 15-20 million HIV infections among adults and some 5-6 million AIDS cases among adults. In some industrialized countries, AIDS could become the leading cause of death among 20-40 year olds during the 1990s. At the same time, AIDS will have a devastating effect on sub-Saharan Africa's urban population, which will see a great increase in child mortality rates and in the number of orphaned children."

Rape is deemed to involve unlawful (extramarital) sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent (this is determined if the rape involved force, threats, administration of drugs, or false representation). The Code also defines offenses in cases of incest, child abuse, prostitution, abduction, controlling the actions and finances of a prostitute, and having unlawful sexual intercourse with a mentally defective woman. Part 9 of the Code outlaws abortion unless it is conducted in an approved establishment after two medical practitioners have determined that continuing the pregnancy would risk the life or physical/mental health of the pregnant woman or if a substantial risk exists that the child would have serious abnormalities. Part 10 outlaws bigamy, and part 12 holds that infanticide performed by a mother suffering postpartum imbalances can be prosecuted as manslaughter. This part also outlaws concealment of the body of a newborn, whether that child died before, at, or after birth, and aggravated assault on any child not more than 14 years old.

As such, condom use is increasing dramatically even though many men say that they do not like using them. Condom sales through social marketing campaigns have increased dramatically in some countries, where tens of millions of condoms are sold annually. For example, during the period 1991-96, annual social marketing sales increased about five-fold in Ethiopia to 21 million, and nine-fold in Brazil to 27 million. These sales reflect the success of condom social marketing campaigns in making condoms accessible and largely affordable. There is also a greater general awareness of AIDS than there used to be, and communication campaigns have shown that condoms are an effective solution. More condoms still need to be used in the ongoing struggle against HIV/AIDS. The author discusses the factors which affect the limited acceptance of condoms, condom use outside of marriage, social marketing, and family planning programs."

They beg, steal, scavenge for food, and sell newspapers, cigarettes, and leis. About 20,000 of the street children prostitute themselves. It is these latter children and adolescents who are at particular risk of HIV infection. Studies in the Philippines indicate that 91% of reported HIV infections are among individuals aged 15-44, the male/female infection ratio is one to one, the transmission rate is 45%, and the most common mode of transmission is through heterosexual intercourse. The high incidence of child sexual abuse and child prostitution in the Philippines would suggest that there are a significant number of children and adolescents under age 15 who are infected with HIV. Caritas Manila has developed an information, education, and communication program for HIV/AIDS prevention focusing upon individuals who have direct influence upon and are in direct contact with people: clergy, religious and civic associations, educators, and social and health workers. Caritas has also to a limited extent reached out directly to populations at risk, while collaborating with human rights advocacy groups and networking with other children-oriented agencies in the interest of providing resources to street children. Efforts must be made to protect the rights of children and provide them with an environment conducive to their growth and development. The author notes how off-duty policemen in Manila help real estate developers forcibly eject the poor from their shelters to clear the way for the construction of new infrastructure without concern for the legal processes and requirements in the humane and peaceful relocation of the homeless poor. Many women and children are hurt and killed in the process. It has also been reported that off-duty policemen in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, are assassinating street children."

For the past 20 years the University Institute for Social and Preventive Medicine as well as the Public Health Service of the Canton of Vaud in Lausanne, Switzerland, have conducted several surveys on the health behavior of teenagers. Ten years ago love affairs ranked 10th within health concerns. In 1992 the same item ranked 3rd: 35.8% of the girls and 28.2% of the boys felt they needed help to solve their problems. In 1982 the percentages were 18% and 15%. In 1987 the Swiss Federal Office for Public Health and the cantonal governments launched an AIDS prevention campaign that stressed the use of condoms. In 1987, only about 50% of adolescents would use any contraception during their first intercourse. The percentage was around 75% in 1993. The percentage of boys who claimed they used condoms on a regular basis increased from 22% in 1987 to 43% in 1992. There was a slight increase in the number of girls engaging in sex at the age of 15-16 years because of the increased availability of condoms. In several French-speaking cantons of Switzerland recently, workshops were set up with the objective of defining future actions regarding the health of adolescents. Girls had had the family planning clinics for many years to discuss sexual and health matters: in the future, either the family planning clinics or the health care structure should be available within the school health services as well as at discos, clubs, and youth centers. It is important to encourage discussions about AIDS and contraception. The current national policy is to encourage the use of both the condom and the pill. Despite concerns about HIV and pregnancy, sexuality is a human exchange that should bring happiness."

        "abstract": "In 1968, Pope Paul VI reinforced the Catholic Church's position forbidding contraception in an encyclical known as \"Humanae Vitae.\" The current Pope, John Paul II, has reiterated this position and stated that use of condoms is forbidden, even to prevent HIV transmission. Several public figures, including the IPPF President and the British Overseas Development Minister, have sought to initiate a dialogue with the Pope to express concern about population growth in developing countries. The Catholic Church is currently opposing efforts on the part of the Presidents of Peru and the Philippines to expand access to family planning (FP) programs. Many of the 500,000 women who die each year of pregnancy complications would have used contraceptives and lived, and an estimated 300 million developing world couples have no access to modern contraception, yet desire no more children. Many Catholics disagree with the Church's stance; 87% of US Catholics surveyed in 1992 stated that FP is the couple's choice. After 25 years of \"Humanae Vitae,\" it is time for the Church to enter into dialogue and join efforts to improve life on earth in the next century."

        "abstract": "A questionnaire was given to a cross-section of nearly equal numbers of sexually active male and female Ugandans in Kampala and in towns and villages. A probable high-risk group, long-distance truck drivers, was also included. 204 people were interviewed. The survey's purpose was to determine the degree of awareness of the magnitude of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) problem, the modes of transmission, behavioral change, available AIDS control activities, and condom use. An attempt was made to relate the degree of awareness AIDS to urban/rural residence, gender, knowledge of an AIDS victim, and previous assessment of risk behavior. The majority perceived socioeconomic pressures as more of a problem than AIDS. All respondents had heard about the disease. Sources knowledge include the media and word-of-mouth. Transmission of sexual intercourse was known to be the main mode of spread. Behavioral change is known to control spread of AIDS. Knowledge and use of condoms is rudimentary. The preventive efficacy of the condom is uncertain; their availability is irregular. Urban residence seems to be associated with more information about condoms and increased condom use. Long-distance truck drivers admitted more risk behavior and condom use than the other respondents. Concerns other than AIDS are perceived to be more urgent in Uganda. Further research activities should look at socioeconomic and cultural factors that lead to high-risk behavior. Uganda has 6772 AIDS cases reported as of May 31, 1989. In 1986, Uganda set up a National AIDS control program which is well organized."

        "title": "Street youth in Colombia: lifestyle, attitudes and knowledge.",
        "abstract": "Gamines in Bogota, Colombia, are youths who live on the streets sometimes keeping loose family ties. They belong to informal gangs, use drugs, and survive by doing itinerant informal sector work, begging, and stealing. The New Life Program (NLP) of the Corporacion SOS Aldea de Ninos worked with three other agencies to investigate the lifestyle, attitudes, and knowledge of gamines about HIV/STDs for the purpose of designing AIDS/STD educational activities for the population. Focus group discussions and educational activities were conducted with 12 girls and 18 boys aged 14-25 years who had started living in NLP's shelter while working on the streets. Participants had spent an average of 7 years on the street typically from age 10. Concentrating primarily upon daily survival, these youths act on the basis of intuition and emotions. Verbal communication is essential to gain and maintain their trust. Although their sexual lives are influenced by the family of origin, institutions in which they have resided, and peers, and their daily lifestyles have much influence. Steady partners are sought for affection and romance, while sexual intercourse is had for pleasure and to satisfy biological need. Some homosexuality and prostitution are tolerated. Gangs also gang-rape and expel members thought to be traitors. The idea of birth control exists among the girls, but the boys overwhelmingly reject condom use. The boys got information on sex from prostitutes, erotic magazines, and adults, but girls rarely talk about sex. Many have had STDs and are generally aware about AIDS, but misinformed about transmission modes, symptoms, and treatment. The boys were especially negative about meeting a person with AIDS. Overall, the youths did not perceive themselves as being at risk for HIV infection. Participants also strongly distrusted the health system because many had been turned away for being dirty or received only callous treatment. The author concludes that we must acknowledge that street youths often continue high-risk behaviors even though they know the potential negative consequences; help them find substitutes for the income, pleasure, power, and communication stemming from sex; convince them of their personal risk through participatory activities; use a multifaceted approach to promote condoms; use an integrated approach; and integrated prevention activities with other services designed to meet their basic needs regarding health, education, and income."

        "abstract": "Women are biologically more susceptible to infection with HIV than men. More than five million women had been infected with HIV by 1993, and an estimated 13 million will have been infected by the year 2000. Women becoming infected with HIV in subSaharan Africa outnumber men 6 to 5 and the AIDS Support Organization in Uganda reports that there are almost six times as many infected young women as there are young men in the country. Many women are poor and uneducated, and depend upon men for their economic security. While a woman may have sex with only one man, the man may have several or many other sex partners. He therefore opens himself and his partners to the risk of HIV infection. Preliminary results from African studies suggest that more than 60% of infected women have only one sex partner. Culture is the greatest obstacle to preventing AIDS among women. Increasing the levels of awareness among women of the risk to which they may be subject, promoting communication and negotiation between men and women as well as between parents and children, encouraging women to help each other learn how to discuss sex and condom use with husbands, involving men as equal partners in safer sex planning, enabling women to obtain and use barrier methods when necessary without a man's consent, and improving the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases will all directly help prevent women from contracting HIV. Raising women's economic and social status will also help by giving women greater control over their lives and bodies."

Investigamos el impacto de la regulación conductual en el sexo anal sin condón entre YSMM, considerando el uso de PrEP, el tipo de pareja y el uso de sustancias como posibles modificadores de la medida del efecto. YSMM (n = 120) completó una encuesta de referencia en línea que evaluó la regulación conductual, el uso de PrEP y los datos sociodemográficos, y encuestas diarias digitales sobre comportamientos sexuales, uso de sustancias y tipo de pareja durante ocho semanas. Utilizamos la regresión de Poisson modificada, controlando por edad, raza, etnia y educación, para examinar la relación entre las puntuaciones del índice de regulación conductual (BRI) y el uso del condón durante el sexo anal. Utilizamos términos de interacción para evaluar la modificación de la medida del efecto por el uso de sustancias antes o durante el sexo y el tipo de pareja, estratificado por el estado de uso de PrEP. Las dificultades en la regulación conductual (puntuaciones más altas) aumentaron la probabilidad de sexo sin condón mientras se consumen sustancias, pero esta asociación no estaba presente en ausencia de consumo de sustancias. Las dificultades para regular la conducta también contribuyeron a una mayor probabilidad de tener relaciones sexuales sin preservativo con sus parejas principales entre quienes no usaban PrEP. Las puntuaciones más altas en el BRI se asociaron con las relaciones sexuales sin preservativo en contextos específicos (es decir, relaciones sexuales con sustancias o con parejas principales). Estos hallazgos resaltan la compleja relación entre la regulación de la conducta y la conducta sexual en el contexto de las opciones biomédicas de prevención del VIH y la dinámica de las relaciones en los YSMM."

        "abstract": "In Brazil, more than 35,000 people have been diagnosed as having AIDS and 425,000 of the country's 150 million population are HIV seropositive. HIV infections continue to take place through infections in the blood supply and ongoing risky behavior associated with sexual relations and IV drug use. A marked lack of knowledge, prejudices and public myths persist about AIDS and despite the continued tide of HIV infection, Brazilians have been reluctant to shed the notion that AIDS is the problem of only discrete risk groups such as homosexuals and drug addicts. Few have changed their sexual behavior or use condoms regularly. Heterosexuals, however, especially women, are the fastest growing group of people with AIDS; 1 of every 6 Brazilians infected with HIV are women. In response, the health ministry has mounted an aggressive STD program which operates regionally in almost all 27 Brazilian states. Many nonprofit organizations have also risen to the challenge of AIDS and HIV infection, and reach out to various target audiences. BEMFAM, for example the major nonprofit family planning agency in Brazil, has become a leader in AIDS prevention. For the first time since its creation in 1965, the group distributed more condoms than oral contraceptive packages in 1992; 15.6 million and 2.9 million, respectively. SOS Crianca is another organization fighting against HIV and AIDS in Brazil. It has sent psychologists and social workers to plazas, alleys, and subway stations where street youths congregate to distribute condoms, counsel male and female prostitutes, educate them about their rights as minors, provide educational games to increase consciousness about health, and work to improve self-esteem."

        "title": "Consequences of early childbearing.",
        "abstract": "By 2000, developing countries will have an estimated 1 billion adolescents who are physically old enough to reproduce themselves but far too young to be responsible, healthy parents of healthy children. Governments must become involved in the issues surrounding adolescent pregnancy and both custom and the laws must change to reflect the needs of young people. The consequences of early childbearing are felt by society as well as the families directly affected. The incidence of births to very young women, both married and unmarried is growing; each year approximately 13 million children are born to young mothers. The percentage of live births to mothers under the age of 20 ranges from 20% in some African and Caribbean countries, to 10-15% in many Latin American countries, 5-10% in Asia, and 1% in Japan. Increased out-of-wedlock adolescent pregnancy is due to many factors: earlier sexual maturity from better childhood health and nutrition, a trend toward later marriage, increased opportunity for opposite sex interaction in schools and in the labor force, and rapid urbanization which weakens traditional family structures and social and cultural controls. Early childbirth is especially dangerous for adolescents and their infants. Compared to women between the ages of 20-35, pregnant women under 20 are at a greater risk for death and disease including bleeding during pregnancy, toxemia, hemorrhage, prolonged and difficult labor, severe anemia, and disability. Life-long social and economic disadvantages may be a consequence of teenage birth. Educational and career opportunities may be limited, as may be opportunities for marriage. Teen mothers tend to have larger completed family sizes, shorter birth intervals resulting in both poorer health status for the family, and a more severe level of poverty. The children also suffer; teens mothers have a higher incidence of low birth weight infants which is associated with birth injuries, serious childhood illness, and mental and physical disabilities. Adolescents' access to family planning information and services is limited. Government programs in developing countries have focused on older women to limit family size. In addition, national laws and local customs often prohibit minors from consenting to medical services. Both the number and proportions of abortions performed for young women have been increasing. Abortions are more physically traumatic for young women who tend to request services later in pregnancy."

        "abstract": "To combat the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Africa, IDRC is supporting collaborative research of the University of Manitoba and the University of Nairobi which targets prostitutes, children, and long-distance truck drivers. The team of 70 researchers (African, Canadian, and European) is led by Dr. J.O. Ndinya-Achola (University of Nairobi) and Dr. Frank Plummer (University of Manitoba). A study of 1700 Nairobi sex workers has shown that 95% are infected with HIV or have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); the remaining 5% of the cohort have not acquired the disease, even though their behavior appears to be the same. Plummer believes their apparent resistance to the disease may hold the answer for a vaccine or a cure. Another area of research concerns the transmission of HIV in breast milk. In a study of 500 children whose mothers were HIV-positive, 47% were infected. Of these, 50% had acquired the virus through breast feeding, a common and necessary practice in Africa because it nourishes the child and prevents disease. The researchers believe that a 3-6 month period of breast feeding, rather than 2 years, among HIV-positive mothers will lower the rate of transmission to infants while providing immunity to other diseases. Dr. J.J. Bwayo leads the research effort which focuses on truck drivers. 30% of 800 tested drivers were positive for HIV; the percentage increases approximately 4% annually. 350 drivers were interviewed in 1990; in spite of adequate knowledge concerning AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, 80% reported having unprotected sex with a prostitute within the last year, and 25% reported weekly sex with sex workers. Only 10% reported they had ever used a condom. Dr. Bwayo's group has established a roadside clinic near a police checkpoint. The truck drivers are offered HIV tests, condoms, education, and counseling while they wait for police to check their rigs. Plummer believes this mobile population is important in the spread of HIV geographically."

        "abstract": "This article presents the results of a multi-site study that aimed to clarify the reasons for the variations in the spread of HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. Behavioral and serological surveys of 1000 males and 1000 females were conducted in two high- and two low-prevalence locations. Results revealed that HIV infection and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were more prevalent among women than men, and were more pronounced among individuals aged 15-19 years in all sites. A high rate of sex partner exchange was observed in low-prevalence areas. High-prevalence areas had more girls who had their sexual debut before the age of 15, greater proportion of married people, and lower age at first marriage than low-prevalence areas. Among married teenage women in high-prevalence locations, higher age of husband was associated with greater risk of HIV infection. Meanwhile, condom use was low among men in all areas. Genital herpes (HSV-2) was more common in high-prevalence settings, and in all 4 locations HSV-2 was associated with increased risk of HIV infection. Male circumcision was almost universal in the low-prevalence areas, whereas only 10-30% of men in high-prevalence sites were circumcised. In a multivariate analysis, being circumcised was significantly linked to a lower risk of the infection. Overall, early sexual debut of females and age at first marriage of men, as well as STDs, were significantly associated to increasing risk of HIV infection. Efforts to reduce HIV infection should consider these factors."

        "abstract": "This study is designed to find out 1) whether the use of intrauterine device (IUD) is a factor in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID); 2) the time interval between insertion of IUD and the diagnosis of PID, and 3) the relationship between the onset of PID and the last mentrual period among IUD users. The use of IUD in 147 patients treated at the Gynaecological Unit of the Kenyatta National Hospital for PID was compared with the use in a sexually active age, parity matched control group. 34% of the patients and 7.5% of the controls were using IUD. Thus the relative risk of developing PID was shown to increase by 4.5 with IUD use. More than 1/2 the PID cases (68%) were between the age group of 21-30 years, the same group as the majority of IUD users. Among the IUD users with PID 56% developed the disease withing the 1st week of the last mentrual period and 78% within 2 weeks of menses. Only 8% of the cases developed PID withing 3 months of IUD insertion; 50% of the cases had been using the device for a year. Oral contraceptives were being used by more controls (33%) than patients (7.5%). Among nulliparous patients and controls, no correlation could be elicited between IUD use and PID development, as in both groups no one had used IUD. There were 147 (82.6%) parous and 31 (17.4%) nulliparous PID patients. Parous women suffered from PID 4.7 times more than nulliparous women. It is proposed that the excessive and irregular bleeding that often accompanies IUD wearing makes certain women vulnerable to PID long after the risk that attends the immediate post-insertion period."

Condom use in the pre-intervention period was associated with positive attitudes toward the method and the perception that condom use was normative among peers. One month after the interventions, both the combination and information groups, but not controls, showed an increase over baseline in AIDS-related knowledge. However, among the 36 students who were coitally active in the 1-month periods before and after the intervention, only the combination intervention was associated with increased condom use. In the combination group, the percentage of episodes of intercourse protected by condoms increased from an average of 21.8% in the month preceding the study to 50% during the 4-week follow-up period. Due to the small sample size and design of the study, it was not possible to determine which component of the multifaceted educational intervention was most responsible for this change."

The incidence of AIDS is increasing in Namibia, as well as the epidemic's impact upon families, society, and the economy. The 1997 Namibian Human Development Report (NHDR) released June 11, 1997, identified AIDS as the number one cause of disease-related death in the country. A connection exists between HIV/AIDS incidence in Namibia and growing poverty. The increasing incidence of the disease has reduced the available labor force, while the cost of caring for affected Namibians is consuming a significant portion of the nation's health budget. Statistics from the NHDR and the 1996 Youth Health Development Report indicate that more than 3000 HIV-positive infants are born in Namibia annually; AIDS was responsible for 4% of infant mortality in the country in 1996; more than 15% of pregnant women in 1996 were HIV positive, almost twice the proportion of those screened in 1994; and 37% of adolescents aged 12-18 years report being sexually active, of whom 28% report not using condoms.

        "abstract": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reported an outbreak of HIV infection among a group of young women in rural Chautauqua county, New York, who apparently contracted HIV from a single, highly infectious man. Although the index case refused to donate blood for analysis, 13 of the 47 women who had sex with the man became infected. The 10 primary contacts who provided blood samples for analysis were infected with highly similar viruses. The 13 women who apparently acquired HIV from the index case had sex with 84 secondary contacts. The resulting AIDS scare led to the counseling and HIV testing of approximately 1400 people in the county, which led to the identification of other HIV-infected individuals unrelated to the index case. The 31% rate of infection transmitted by the index case suggests that HIV can be spread rapidly by only a few individuals. It used to be thought that a person is most likely to transmit HIV either during acute infection, before the immune system has fully responded to the virus, or late in infection when the immune system has been destroyed. Neither sexually transmitted diseases nor IV drug use was associated with HIV transmission in this cluster of cases."

The government plans to increase awareness of HIV/AIDS at the grassroots, and gradually include condom use in public campaigns which now focus upon avoiding casual sex. At Singapore's first national AIDS conference, participants shared studies which showed that although a majority of Singaporeans know that HIV/AIDS is largely transmitted through sex or the sharing of injection equipment in IV drug use, up to 40% worry that they can become infected in other ways, such as from a diseased person sneezing or coughing upon them."

Findings from two clinical studies show latex condoms to be highly effective against the sexual transmission of HIV when used consistently and correctly during sexual intercourse. The European Study on Heterosexual HIV Transmission followed 123 heterosexual HIV-discordant couples over the period 1987-91, while the second study in Italy followed 171 female partners of HIV-infected men. Sections briefly discuss consistent and correct condom use, other studies indicating that condoms have a high contraceptive failure rate, the Mariposa study which found several brands of condoms to leak viruses similar to HIV, safer sex education detractors on the basis of regular condom breakage, whether it is realistic to think that people will use condoms consistently and correctly, condom testing and regulation, the absence of microscopic holes in condoms through which HIV may pass, the 74% effectiveness of the female condom (Reality) in preventing pregnancy, nonoxynol-9, abstinence as a means of preventing HIV infection, the rationale behind the federal government's renewed support for condom use, education programs about condoms, and why the federal government would promote condoms when they are not 100% foolproof. The report therefore confirms the federal government's 1988 recommendations for using condoms to prevent the transmission of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, in addition to providing new compelling information about consistent and correct condom use as well as the female condom."

The 1st reported AIDS case in Ghana was in March 1986 and by the end of 1986 the number of AIDS cases had already increased to 26. Between 1986 and 1987, the increase was 35%, but in 1988, the increase was 600%. There was a fall in AIDS cases between 1990 and 1991 (1011-903) but health officials believe that the 1991 number is low due to underdiagnosis and underreporting. The total number of AIDS cases is 3140. Almost 75% of the cases acquired HIV from outside Ghana. Most of them were female prostitutes. The female to male ratio is 4:1 compared with 1:1 in other African countries. HIV prevalence rate among prostitutes in Accra is 2.5%, 4.6% among patients of a sexually transmitted disease clinic, and 0.5-1.5% among blood donors. The Ghanian AIDS Advisory Committee, created in 1985, counsels the government on how to prevent HIV transmission. The 1989 Medium Term Plan supports creation of HIV surveillance systems; information, education, and communication (IEC) efforts; testing of the blood supply; psychosocial support programs for HIV-infected people; and adequate clinical management of HIV/AIDS cases. Regional and District AIDS Committees are in charge of implementing the plan. The National Advisory Counsel on AIDS guides AIDS policy development. HIV/AIDS control activities are integrated into the existing primary health care system. Some obstacles to HIV/AIDS control efforts are inadequate funding including donor agencies not honoring their pledges and inappropriate allocation of funds by the unstable government, insufficient supply of reagents to screen blood, and some hospitals still using unscreened blood. The greatest obstacle is long-held sociocultural beliefs, attitudes, and practices in Ghana. For example, even though 80% of the people know how HIV is transmitted, most people still practice risky sex behavior. Many people equate the condom with infidelity so condom use is low."

It may even encourage risky behavior if it promotes an ineffective means of contraception. The IPPF has published a very useful report on youth's sexual and reproductive health needs, specifically the need for tailoring family planning/reproductive health programs to meet the needs of youth. The report provides examples of successful projects in different countries that health and sex educators in the Pacific can adapt. Teenagers in the Pacific do become pregnant and suffer from sexually transmitted diseases, indicating that their family planning/reproductive health needs are not being met. In the Pacific as well as elsewhere, the norms and values of adults in authority constrain out-of-school programs for young people. Traditional family planning programs only serve married women or couples. Adolescents also do not seek services at family planning programs even if they do not serve just married women or couples because the teens fear the moralizing and judgmental attitudes of the staff. A tragic repercussion of this neglect of adolescents' reproductive health needs in Fiji is the increase in infanticide. The stigma surrounding unmarried mothers often drive young women to conduct such a desperate act. They tend to find no support from families and friends and no future. What is needed is family planning services that are accessible to unmarried teenagers and young women living in poverty, both of whom are most at risk of unwanted pregnancies."

Almost all of the participants described their peers as being sexually active, with girls, on average, having first intercourse at age 12, and boys at age 13. The ideal age on average was, however, thought to be 20 years. Most reported getting their information about sex from their peers, followed by books and magazines, and movies. Parents were mentioned the least number of times as being sources of information about sex. Radio and television were cited as the most common sources for information on HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STD). Sexually active youth were rarely given practical advice from parents, teachers, and elders on how to manage their sexuality and prevent contracting HIV/AIDS and other STDs. The beginning of multipartyism and drastic inflation were the biggest changes observed by the respondents in their lifetimes, but AIDS was cited as the greatest threat facing them and Kenya as a whole.

        "abstract": "In 1995, the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration reported that there were 360,000 documented contract workers deployed to various international destinations, 33.1% of whom were sea-based contract workers. It is accepted in Philippine society that seamen stationed abroad for several months remain sexually active. They often have unprotected sexual intercourse with several male and female sex partners, exposing themselves and their partners to the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections. The Department of Health has therefore given some priority to involve overseas workers in AIDS education efforts. Seamen, in particular, have been found to engage in high-risk behaviors based upon the recognized routes of HIV transmission. The ISSA developed and implemented a project to address the HIV/AIDS education needs of this group of men and their partners. ISSA's HIV/AIDS Education and Prevention project used the couple approach in its activities, noting that couples and partners must work together to practice safer sex measures. The project involved 60 seamen and 60 women who were either wives or girlfriends of the seamen; more than half of the participants were husband-wife couples. The project functioned upon the premise that both partners have to be well-informed about HIV/AIDS in order to practice effective prevention measures."

        "title": "Seropositive sex workers and HIV / AIDS prevention: a need for realistic policy development.",
        "abstract": "In a major change of official responses to prostitution many programs strive to reduce the incidence of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among sex workers and clients by encouraging safer sex, albeit still trying to ensure that only HIV-negative people engage in sex work. Legal sanctions have been used to limit the activities of seropositive sex workers under the assumption that sex workers with HIV will transmit the virus because of a high prevalence of unprotected sex practices in some places. Where safer sex is the norm for commercial sex transactions, the concern is that sex workers may neglect safe practices and customers may become infected. The fact is that often the clients demand unprotected sex, even when sex workers prefer to use condoms. The risk of accidental infection when protected sex is practiced may even be lower in commercial transactions in which at least one partner is very experienced in condom use and other safe practices. It is usually assumed that HIV-positive sex workers will not inform clients of their status, however, and clients will not inform sex workers of their serostatus either. Where sex workers practice safe sex, intervention programs should provide education on condom use and ensure the availability of inexpensive condoms. In addition to gynecological, antenatal and STD services, health and social services, including child care and legal support, have to be easily accessible. Religious and cultural impediments to realistic HIV/STD prevention should be studied in order to modify or eliminate them. Sex workers who are seropositive probably behave similarly to other people in a community with regard to exposing others to risk, and they are careful about not infecting others, especially if it is guaranteed that their environment supports them."

        "title": "Children, health and AIDS.",
        "abstract": "The World Health Organization expects there to be 10 million children infected with HIV by the year 2000 as a result of mother to child transmission. Most of these children will in developing countries, but there is also a growing problem in Europe and the US. Rates of HIV-1 transmission from infected mothers to their babies in developing countries range 25-39%, but are as low as 12% in some more developed countries. Recent studies have shown a 26% transmission rate from mothers who were infected post-natally and a 16% rate for those infected pre-natally. Infection rates do not seem to be related to the duration of breast feeding. Pediatricians with experience of HIV infection, however, think that the rate of transmission is much higher than statistics would indicate. AIDS is firmly established among heterosexuals. It should therefore be clear that the number of infected infants and children will continue to increase. The author presents concerns with regard to the clinical management problem of diagnosing HIV infection in children, the main indicator diseases for AIDS in children, the Bangui criteria used for the clinical definition of AIDS, psychological and social factors, confidentiality, childhood immunizations for HIV-infected children, the sexual abuse of children, and children orphaned because of AIDS."

        "abstract": "AIDS and HIV figures released in June 1990 by Uganda's AIDS Control Programme (ACP) prompted the revamping of the country's national AIDS initiative, the passage of legislation designed to stamp out sexual exploitation of minors and a reluctant pledge by President Yoweri Museveni to advocate condom use. Uganda has a massive AIDS prevention campaign estimated to reach 80% of the population, but AIDS cases are doubling every 6 months according to Health Minister Zack Kaheru. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) have been linked as a co-factor in HIV transmission, therefore treatment of STDs will be linked to the anti-AIDS campaign in free clinics for the treatment of STDs operating in Kampala and Jinja and in new ones planned for Mbale, Mbarara and Fort Portal. The Uganda Aids Commission was created in an effort to strengthen the ACP by insuring that all government departments address AIDS prevention. New laws designed to curb the spread of the disease by sexual contact raised the age of consent for sexual intercourse from 14 to 18 years of age, made prostitution and homosexuality illegal and redefined incest to include extended family members. President Museveni urged Ugandans to use condoms to protect themselves from HIV infection. Because condoms are not 100% reliable, and because their use is not a popular option among rural people due to cultural and religious beliefs, President Museveni and ACP Director Dr. Warren Namara agree that the ultimate weapon against AIDS is educating people to rethink their sexual attitudes and actions. Hopeful signs include more openness about AIDS and more seeking of information about AIDS among the people."

        "abstract": "In many parts of the world, elective sterilization has become the preferred method of contraception for large numbers of women who have completed their families. Some concern has been expressed in the medical literature about the adverse psychological sequelae of the procedure. However, although many sterilizations are performed postpartum, there have been no attempts to separate the effects which may indeed be attributable to sterilization from those often associated with pregnancy and the puerperium. The present paper reviews major research findings in the perinatal field and relates them to results of selected studies of female sterilization. The review concentrates on psychological disturbances in the postpartum period, but changes during pregnancy, as well as disturbances in postnatal sexuality and menstruation, are also discussed. Well-designed studies are necessary in order to overcome the methodological difficulties often encountered in the existing literature."

The prostitutes are part of a group, The Friends of Doug and Rose, that seeks to spread awareness of sexually transmitted diseases, especially AIDS, among their peers and the general public and to promote condom use. This group had its origins in an AIDS prevention campaign conducted in Yaounde in 1987 and targeted at prostitutes. Over 125 of these prostitutes, 7% of whom were positive for the AIDS virus, were trained as peer health educators. The idea to produce a play came out of a role-playing exercise aimed at teaching the prostitute peer health educators techniques for motivating their colleagues to use condoms during all commercial sexual encounters. The play presents a true picture of the working lives of prostitutes and the repercussions of sexually transmitted diseases. The play's characters agree to make condom use a prerequisite to accepting clients. The group is joining with a condom social marketing program to travel throughout Cameroon presenting the play to neighborhood associations, health centers, and sexually transmitted diseases clinics. The activity is in keeping with the African tradition of using street theater to spread messages on health and family planning. To ensure that those impacted by the play's message are actually able to obtain condoms, the US Agency for International Development has supplied the Government of Cameroon with 9 million condoms."

        "abstract": "Women's groups are campaigning in Zambia to criminalize sexual cleansing, a practice in which a widow (usually) or widower must have sexual relations with a relative of the dead spouse in order to be rid of the spouse's ghost. It is believed that future sexual partners of the surviving spouse will go mad or die if this is not done. The National Women's Lobby Group is asking for parliamentary legislation banning the practice. The Family Life Movement is unsupportive of the practice, but believes legislation will not stop this ingrained part of the culture. The Society for Women Against AIDS in Zambia (SWAAZ) agrees that legislation will do nothing; however, education that changes people's attitudes might. Deputy Health Minister, Dr. Kalumba, believes legislation would protect vulnerable groups, but would not make people change their lifestyles. To promote such a change, the Ministry has begun a community project that includes workshops and seminars aimed at traditional leaders, healers, and ordinary people. The YWCA has convinced people to conduct nonsexual cleansing. In this era of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), sexual cleansing can be deadly."

        "abstract": "Commissioned by the Brazilian health ministry to conduct a publicity campaign designed to encourage the use of condoms, the Master Communication and Marketing company conducted a survey in which it collected dozens of nicknames for the penis. The television component of the campaign involves an actor who holds a heart-to-heart conversation with his penis, recommending that it use condoms and showing it, with a candle, how to do so. \"Braulio\" was chosen as the name for the penis. Braulio, however, is a common men's name in Brazil. Shortly after the launch of the campaign, men named Braulio staged numerous protests against the use of their name. The Health Minister subsequently suspended the campaign on September 23, 1995, to allow selection of an alternate name for the penis. The campaign has resumed, this time using eight impersonal expressions such as \"partner\" and \"him\" to identify the penis, and is planned to run for three months despite the controversy. A journalist formerly named Braulio has officially changed his name to avoid being mocked, a lawyer in Sao Paulo named Braulio will continue to head a suit against the government filed by a group of Braulios alleging moral damage, and the Catholic Church criticizes the bluntness of the campaign, which mentions oral and anal sex on the radio. Nonetheless, a health ministry poll of almost 1000 people found that 80% supported the campaign. The coordinator of the Program of Sexually Transmitted Diseases insists that the blunt language is necessary to reach the lower-income, less-educated masculine population. Official figures indicate that 80% of the slightly more than 71,000 registered AIDS cases in Brazil are among men aged 19-35 years, and it is among men aged 20-40 years that HIV is spreading most rapidly. The health ministry has been bombarded with alternate nicknames for the penis since the initial uproar, enough to fill a book. The article points out that the nicknames vary according to region."

The project particularly targets people who regularly cross the Lao-Thai border and their sex partners.

Discussion of the issue and society's views is suggested. The views of a few civil servants from Iname are briefly presented in the text. They generally disagree with incarceration of such youths, and recommend there placement in a semi-open environment supported by specially trained doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists, and nurses. Ideally, a home-like setting is preferred where these young women and others in similar situations may undergo treatment while carrying on with their lives."

It is important to counsel such women that the pill is not enough if they have several different partners, or even if their partner does so. Some ways to emphasize this point are to write the condom prescription, perhaps after having discussed different brands with her and decided on a brand, on the prescription sheet. Both physicians and family planning clinics could consider prescribing or dispensing 6 months' worth of condoms, not just 3 or 6, each time a client visits. Another aid is to employ movies, videotapes, posters and pamphlets to get the message across. Finally, it is vital to think through one's own values on the topic of double protection and to believe in it. Reproductive health professionals should at least be prepared to offer their clients protection from infection."

Indeed 99% of these maternal deaths occurred in developing countries, especially Africa. 50 UN ambassadors and representatives attended this event which was endorsed by 40 health and development organizations. Film celebrity Lauren Hutton also attended to show her support. IPPF hoped this event would bring attention to the ongoing need to reduce unwanted pregnancy by providing family planning information and services. The Regional Director of IPPF noted that family planning is the most cost effective means to do so. The Regional Office's Programme Support Director also emphasized the need for trained birth attendants, emergency obstetric care, and proper nutrition. In 1990, the number of unwanted births was about 30 million. For each maternal death, 10-15 women are disabled during childbirth and 25 million pregnant women face serious childbirth complications. A World Bank study showed that if governments would invest just US$1.50/person/year to include prenatal care and family planning into primary health care programs, maternal deaths would fall considerably within 10 years. This amount had been invested during the last 15 years, IPPF would have only needed to display 167,000 flowers. If governments do not take action soon, IPPF will need to display 650,000 flowers in 2000. The Western Hemisphere Regional Office of IPPF has therefore established the Planned Motherhood Fund to expand and strengthen family planning and appropriate health services for women at highest risk of pregnancy-related death, especially teenagers and women in rural areas and urban slums."

This report focuses on the 2 programs in the capital Accra that try to stop the spread of AIDS by working with the prostitute population, and programs by the Technical Committee on AIDS to combat AIDS in rural areas. One was developed by the Family Health International (FHI) and the other was developed by the Planned Parenthood Association of Ghana (PPAG). FHI's pilot project starts by educating volunteer prostitute \"leaders\" (a title given those enrolled) about AIDS, protective barrier methods of contraception, and common types of misinformation. All participants were encouraged to give up prostitution, and those who didn't became \"leaders\" who were in charged of both educating 10 other prostitutes and supplying them with the free condoms supplied by FHI. The program even checks the willingness of those enrolled to practice safe sex by having men pose as customers to see if the prostitutes are offering condoms to sexual partners and/or using spermicides. These men do not have sex with the women, but they do pay them for their time. PPAG's AIDS prevention program takes a different approach. This program tries to provide prostitutes with an alternative source of income. When prostitutes were polled about reasons for selecting their profession, most replied that they entered it during a period of economic hardship and were desperate for income. The PPAG provides these women with capital to start feasible small businesses. The highest incidence of AIDS is in eastern Ghana where many who left during hard times went to areas with a higher incidence of AIDS (i.e. the Ivory Coast), and then returned to be taken care of by family when stricken ill. The Technical Committee set up a home care project that treats patients at home and thus allows district health staff to monitor the spread of HIV, and counsel affected families and communities. Villages are told to report any sick newcomers to the health staff so that they can be treated and tested for AIDS. The Technical Committee with the Red Cross's sponsorship is educating the traditional healers on AIDS and HIV infection."

Most respondents were single, middle class, and White; their ages ranged from 18 to 51 years. The data analysis was restricted to the 155 men and women who had at least 1 new partner in the 3 years preceding the survey. Respondents worried most about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) when engaging in sex with a new partner. 86% indicated concern about AIDS had affected their sexual behavior, most often by increasing their condom use and decreasing casual sex. 91% of women and 79% of men said that condoms give them greater peace of mind. Women worried more than men about AIDS when they had a new sexual partner and were more likely to limit their number of partners, work harder on an existing sexual relationship, give up casual sex, or give up sex with new partners. Men's subjective condom experiences were related to their penile functioning (erection and ejaculation) and the threat of loss of sexual pleasure. Multiple regression equations revealed that, among men, condom use with new partners was associated with worrying about AIDS and younger age; among women, peace of mind was a positive predictor. With casual partners, more partners led to increased condom use among women and worrying about AIDS was a predictor for men; peace of mind was predictive for both genders. 53% of men compared to 21% of women expected to meet a new sexual partner at the bar where they were interviewed, and 36% of men and 19% of women were carrying condoms with them."

        "abstract": "Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence exists that condom use can prevent the transmission of HIV. Indeed condoms are the only recommended contraceptive for prevention of HIV transmission. Most epidemiologic studies demonstrate that condom use protects women from acquiring HIV, but few examine the effectiveness of condoms in preventing heterosexual transmission to men. Condom use is not always an acceptable contraceptive method, however. Laboratory tests show that the spermicides nonoxynol-9, octoxynol, benzalkonium chloride, and menfegol deactivate HIV and kill other organisms that cause sexually transmitted diseases. In the field, however, spermicides are not reliable in protection against HIV transmission. For example, a study in Kenya of 98 prostitutes reveals that 55% of the nonoxynol-9 users seroconverted whereas 45% of the placebo users did. Another study in Kenya involving prostitutes demonstrates that oral contraceptive (OC) users had a 3 fold increased risk of acquiring HIV. Yet a different study in Kenya finds that HIV infected women were not more likely to be using OCs than noninfected women. There was an association with 6 years of OC use and HIV infection, however. In addition, a study in Milan, Italy provides evidence of a possible protective effect of OC use. It shows that HIV negative women tend to use OCs more often than did HIV positive women. Nevertheless both the last mentioned study in Kenya and the Italian study shows an increased HIV infection rate with IUD users. Furthermore, HIV infection does not appear to affect fertility. For example, 1 study shows pregnancy rates of 11.6/100 person years for HIV infected women and 10.3 for noninfected women."

On a scale in which 7 represented the most positive response, mean attitude toward condom use was 5.39 with a steady partner and 5,88 with a casual partner. The average condom knowledge score was 75.2%, but Whites were considerably more knowledgeable than their Black counterparts. Unexpectedly, knowledge was significantly negatively correlated with the perception that condoms are pleasant to use. Greater knowledge showed no association with frequency of condom use in the past three months or the intent to use condoms in the future, These findings suggest a need for interventions that challenge negative perceptions of condom use in this high-risk population."

        "abstract": "Policy and program planners use information gained from computer-based statistical models to develop interventions against AIDS. Models of the epidemic's effect, however, show widely differing impacts on population. With the recent entry of a British researcher's view of the impact of AIDS on the population of Africa, the debate between researchers has only intensified. While the World Health Organization (WHO) has conservatively estimated that 40 million people will be infected with HIV by the year 2000, Roy Anderson of the University of London and Robert May of Oxford University expect AIDS to cause population decline in Africa after the year 2002. Major donors and researchers feel that while population growth rates will decline, growth rates will not turn negative due to AIDS. The British researchers, however, do not consider their views to differ greatly from those of US researchers, but they do have problems with overly conservative WHO projections. Their research assumes a higher degree of transmission between core groups of HIV-positive people, including prostitutes, IV drug users, and general populations in Africa's hardest hit areas. They project infection prevalence to reach 50% or more in some areas. Greater levels of prostitution and poverty, as well as the tendency for males to have sex with increasingly younger females, will lead to higher HIV incidence and prevalence in Africa. Family planning experts are voicing their concern over the integrity of these models and question whether they are more than simply educated guesses of what the future holds. Even though projections are uncertain and extremely data-dependent, family planning efforts must continue. Whether or not the AIDS pandemic eventually levels off in certain areas, critics must remember that family planning improves maternal and child health in addition to contributing to lower growth rates and prevent AIDS."

        "title": "What do young black South Africans think about AIDS?",
        "abstract": "In South Africa, a fatalistic attitude prevails among young black youth toward prevention of HIV transmission. Many of the 3 million black migrant laborers in single-sex hostels have many partners who are prostitutes. Due to culture, race, and class, black women are so oppressed that they cannot even require sex partners to wear condoms. Blacks perceive condoms as a governmental means to control population growth. The Centre for Health and Social Studies has learned that 14-17 year old blacks have been sexually active for a long time, so it has decided to also market its AIDS prevention program to 11-13 year olds. AIDS has not yet reached epidemic proportions in South Africa, however, and a full scale intervention program implemented between the end of 1992 and mid-1993 could stem the epidemic. The Health and Refugee Trust has developed a data base about the attitudes of South African refugees toward AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. It plans to distribute educational materials to hostels, squatter settlements, and rural communities. The Transport and General Workers Union has also set up an AIDS prevention program since truckers are at high risk of HIV infection. At the end of 1991, 445,000 people in South Africa have been infected with HIV. Heterosexuality is the predominate mode of HIV transmission among blacks, but among whites, it is homosexuality. Educated, affluent whites tend to be knowledge about AIDS and practice safer sex. Among the working class whites, however, knowledge levels are high, but they do not necessarily practice safer sex. Awareness tends to be quite high among blacks, but they do not generally practice safer sex. South Africa and the US are the only 2 developed countries that do not provide health care for all. This weak system limits AIDS prevention efforts. 80% of whites have health insurance compared with only 7% of blacks."

        "abstract": "A great deal of avoided if political and religious leaders, educators, health care providers and the mass media would band together in an effort to promote condom use. Condoms use protects against unwanted pregnancies, STDs and AIDS. Yet, public discussions on condom use are rate. In the US, political leaders avoid mentioning the topic, and television networks severely restrict the airing of public service announcements for condoms. Worldwide, an estimated 100 billion acts of sexual intercourse take place every year. A recent report indicates that it would take a modest 13 billion condoms a year to protect everyone who is at risk of contracting AIDS and other STDs, and risk of having an unwanted pregnancy. Currently, worldwide production of condoms stands at about 6 billion a year. Furthermore, condom makers have the capacity to increase production by some 2 billion, and could add new capacity in about 2 years. Many believe that marketing condoms is a difficult enterprise, since men often report that condoms reduce pleasure, cause embarrassment, or are not available when needed. The challenge for markets, then, is to create demand. This is especially true in the US, where prime-time advertising and the use of popular entertainment, such as soap operas, could promote condoms as both safe and satisfying. In the developing world, the challenge is to make condoms widely available and affordable. Some changes have taken place since 1981, when AIDS first came into the spotlight. In the US, people now discuss the topic of STDs more openly. But an all-out effort to promote condom use has not yet begun."

        "abstract": "Better information is needed to understand sexual behavior and other variables that may influence condom use in order to develop successful education campaigns promoting their use. To this end, this study examined the AIDS Risk Reduction Model among an equal number of men and women (300) attending the public sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in San Francisco in 1989. The population is indicative of the population diagnosed with syphilis and gonorrhea. Clinical data from medical charts were linked with questionnaire data. Variables that were identified as affecting condom use at last intercourse were perceived susceptibility to HIV infection, knowledge of HIV transmission, and perception of the seriousness of HIV infection. Also included were condom use factors such as ill fit of condoms or decreased sexual spontaneity, and sexual communication. Attitudes and beliefs were scaled items which had to have alpha coefficients greater than .60 in order to be included. Evaluation of significant factors was accomplished with the Mantel-Haenzel chi-square and student's t-test. Gender specific multivariate logistic regression was used to control for confounding factors such as age, stability of the relationship, and total number of sex partners in a year. Condom breakage was reported. The population was 57% (78) male and black or Hispanic and 51% (84) female and black or Hispanic. 46% (138) had incomes of $5000. 47% were newly diagnosed with an STD on the interview day. 64% had prior STDs. 2 reported having HIV infection and 2 reported having a sex partner with HIV infection. 51% stated that their steady partner had at least one STD during the prior sexual encounters. Sexual behavior was reported for partner's sexual involvement with others in the past 2 months, condom use among steady and casual partners, knowledge of HIV transmission, past condom usage, and use of condoms at last intercourse. In the multivariate analysis, black or Hispanic men who used drugs or alcohol at last sexual encounter and black or Hispanic men whose partners did not want to use condoms were less likely to use condoms at last intercourse. Less condom use for women was associated with blacks or Hispanics, the belief that condoms reduce sexual pleasure, the difficulty in exercising control over their use, and involvement with a steady partner."

        "abstract": "The basic clinical aspects of contraception, fertility regulation, family planning, and family health are described as they relate to parameters of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), AIDS Related Complex (ARC), and sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in man. Special emphasis is placed on: the biology/pathology of HIV; microbiology/immunology of human semen; condoms/spermicides; IUDS and HIV infections; STDs; heterosexual/homosexual transmission of HIV; risk factors/cofactors and HIV; prevention of HIV; clinical manifestations and opportunistic infections; and the integration of family planning programs with STD/HIV services. Human semen contains a wide variety of cellular elements and microbiological contaminants. THe major leukocyte subpopulations in the semen include: granulocytes, monocytes/macrophages, B lymphocytes, helper and suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and antibodies. HIV penetrates several types of cells: macrophages, antibody-producing B cells, endothelial cells of blood vessels, and non-neuronal brain cells. Sperm-specific moieties have a high potential of immunogenicity. Condoms have been recommended to HIV carriers, both to prevent sexual transmission of HIV to uninfected sexual partners and to avoid repeated contact with HIV which influences clinical outcome of AIDS. Fluctuations in sales of condoms are due to the removal of IUDs from the American market; homosexual fear of HIV infection; and the discontinuation of oral contraceptive use among older women. The FDA has authorized anti-AIDS benefits in advertising/labelling of condoms. With the use of IUDs, a local infection of susceptible cervical cells from infected semen precedes systemic spread of HIV. Multiple sex partners increase the risk of HIV/STD infections. Further complications may also involve immunopathological interactions among multiple viral infections. With copper IUDs there may be urticarial eruptions and eczematous dermatitis and such cases with exposure of subcutaneous areas of the skin are considered as cofactors for HIV infection. HIV-infected women should avoid pregnancy and be given the highest priority for family planning services."

In this context, many organizations in the country are fighting HIV/AIDS, working to encourage people to adopt HIV/AIDS and STD risk reduction behaviors. Six Zambian AIDS organizations convened for a 2.5-day workshop in Lusaka in September to exchange ideas and discuss their work with young people. Participants discussed health education with youths, community home-based care, and the peer education and life-skills training approach pioneered by the Copperbelt Health Education Project (CHEP). Although adolescents are highly vulnerable, two organizations have found them open to sympathetic health education and willing to become peer educators. However, once in the field, peer educators must remain integrated within the community and their target audiences. Youth-friendly, confidential reproductive health services integrated into community clinics are urgently needed. Nursing staff must avoid being aggressive, insensitive, and judgmental. CHEP will make life skills a priority over the next 2 years, and plans to train at least 150 people, including all of its own staff. It was also noted at the workshop that young people are not passive recipients of health messages, but active service providers and shapers of policy."

        "abstract": "In Brazil, the murder of seven homeless children sleeping near a cathedral in the heart of Rio de Janeiro shocked the international community but came as no surprise to Brazilians who were aware of the risks faced by their country's approximately seven million street children. Now, in addition to the threat of violence and abuse, street children in cities around the world also face the danger of becoming infected with HIV. Estimates of seroprevalence in Rio range from 1.5% to 7.5%, and the children place themselves at risk by engaging in prostitution for survival as well as by having sex with each other. Their vulnerability is also increased by their use of inhalant drugs, which can lead to a loss of control. The Brazilian Center for the Defense of Children and Adolescents (CDCA), which has been working with street children since 1987, added HIV prevention to its mandate in 1989. CDCA gets each youth a birth certificate as a first step in building self-esteem. For a time, CDCA operated a permanent \"drop-in\" center that offered health treatment and counseling and provided special services to young transvestites and girls. Local authorities forced CDCA to close the center when the children began sleeping in its doorway (indicating that their primary need was for shelter). After the drop-in center closed, CDCA began identifying health professionals in governmental and nongovernmental clinics who agreed to treat the street children. In return, CDCA shares its resources with clinic staff. CDCA also encouraged the government to open its first shelters for the children and advised shelter staff on how to work with the children. In 1990, CDCA achieved legislation that requires the government to give the children access to free medical care, food, and shelter. This action has multiplied the number of youth who receive services and the number of professionals trained to work with them."

        "abstract": "20% of the world's population is aged 10-19 years. Annually, almost 15 million young women under age 20 become mothers. However, surveys in developing countries show that 20-60% of the pregnancies and births to women under age 20 are mistimed or unwanted. While later marriage age in many places has provoked a decline in birth rates among young women, levels of sexual relations before marriage are increasing. Such sexual behavior opens sexually active young women to the risks of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortion, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Millions of young people become infected with STDs annually. Among all age groups in the US, young women aged 15-19 have the highest incidence of gonorrhea among females and young men aged 15-19 have the second highest incidence among males. At least half of all people infected with HIV are under age 25. The UNDP/UNFPA/WHO/World Bank Special Program of Research, Development, and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP) completed 9 studies in 1996 on adolescent reproductive health. 14 studies were completed before 1996, and 18 are still underway."

There has been some research on this topic in adult populations in the USA and the Netherlands. We know less about how these conditions affect young people. Young people are vulnerable to mental health challenges. They are also at a stage where they are navigating sex and relationships. Few studies have been done on this topic in the UK. This was a UK-based study. We looked at how common skin conditions affect sexual health and relationships in young people. We studied 73 people aged 17 to 25. They all had long-term (‘chronic’) skin conditions. They answered questionnaires about mental health, quality of life and sexual function. We then carried out in-depth interviews with 17 of them. Over half of the participants reported an impact on their intimate relationships. Participants faced three main challenges. The first was less confidence in pursuing relationships. The second was physical symptoms impeding intimacy. The third was a feeling of struggling, despite support from partners or clinicians. Many felt unable to discuss these issues with their doctors. Most (78%) said their doctor did not adequately ask about their intimacy concerns. Only 32% felt comfortable discussing these issues with their doctor. Participants wanted communication tailored to young people. This included active listening and creating an environment suitable for sharing concerns. Participants suggested that sexual and mental health resources could be helpful. Psychosexual counselling or group therapy were also mentioned. This study highlights the need to address intimacy concerns in young people with chronic skin conditions. It also found that there should be more open discussion in consultations."

The 400 couples, all from the town of Iwanovo, were under 25 years of age and in their first marriage. The average age at marriage in this group was 22.1 years for men and 21.6 years for women. 77% of males and 65% of females had been sexually active before marriage; 41% of the men and 33% of the women had experienced coitus before their 18th birthday. However, only 13% of respondents could be considered minimally knowledgeable about contraception, and contraceptive use in the respondents who were sexually active before marriage was 20%. 10% of sexually active female respondents were pregnant at the time of marriage. Characteristics of the life-styles of these respondents were poor nutrition habits, avoidance of exercise and sports, smoking, alcohol consumption, and failure to consult a physician in the case of an acute illness. 1/3 of the men and 1/5 of the men surveyed were suffering from a chronic disease. Moreover, 21% of males and 23% of females had medical and social risk factor scores that could jeopardize the health of potential offspring. Recommendations to improve the likelihood of healthy marriage and parenthood in the USSR include the teaching of healthy habits to schoolchildren, mass medical screenings for the early detection of disease, the provision of printed materials about contraception to engaged couples, counseling of couples on ways to increase the odds of having a healthy infant, and the opening of special reception centers for young people where they can obtain guidance on these issues."

This program has been so successful that it has increased the number of youth it influences 3-fold. The sexuality and family planning education programs and counseling attract the youth. Teachers, school administrators, and parents support the YWCA program because it relates the controversial issue of adolescent sexuality with a rise in girls' school dropout rates. The YWCA's Counselling Centre in Accra is the first youth facility in Ghana to provide family life education and family planning services to in-school and out-of-school youths. The YWCA is also collaborating with an association of truck drivers and young male street vendors to distribute condoms in the marketplace. Community and parental concern over rising teenage pregnancy rates, sexually transmitted diseases and HIV infections, and girls leaving school motivates the YWCA to offer this program. In Ghana, 19% of female adolescents have at least 1 child. 75% of these teenagers either did not want or plan these births. In conclusion, the YWCA program hopes to establish a consensus that youth must be helped, both for their good and for the good of Ghana."

People who accept sterilization as their method of family planning therefore need to be encouraged to protect themselves against HIV/AIDS and STDs even after they have been sterilized. Since women return less often to family planning providers following their sterilization procedure, they need to be advised to protect themselves against HIV and STDs before the sterilization is performed. 42% of the 2782 women who underwent tubal sterilizations at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston during 1991-96 indicated their intention in a cross-sectional study to use condoms after sterilization. 20% of all respondents, aged 18-51 years, had a known risk factor for HIV, and almost 25% reported regular condom use for contraception or disease protection during the 3 months before sterilization. Planned condom use increased from 32% in 1991 to 51% in 1996, irrespective of age, marital status, or ethnic background. Of the 646 women who used condoms before being sterilized, almost half indicated no plans to do so after the procedure. The following factors were associated with condom use: relatively younger age, black ethnicity, unmarried status, history of previous STD, no steady partner, having a higher number of previous sex partners, past use of condoms to prevent disease transmission, and lack of partner involvement in the decision to undergo sterilization."

By 1988, a formal, community-based intervention was created to promote condom use, provide health education as well as literacy and vocational training, and seek better working and living conditions for the prostitutes. The first task of the Calabar Project was to overcome the resistance of the hotel owners and managers where the prostitutes work and to win the confidence of the women. The owners and managers had to be convinced that it was in their best interest for the women to insist on condom use by their clients. The women had to be informed about the nature of HIV/AIDS and to be convinced that the project sought improvements in their general welfare. This was accomplished by helping the prostitutes improve both their relationship with the local police and their access to health services. Negotiations with hotel owners stabilized the prostitutes' rent for a year to enable the women to increase their charges for services and reduce the number of clients they needed so they could insist on condom use. Peer educators were trained to provide health education and to teach prostitutes techniques to get clients to use condoms. Clients were reached through the prostitutes and by providing information to small groups in hotel bars. Condoms were initially distributed for free and eventually were sold through a social marketing program. Peer educators also encouraged prostitutes and their clients to use a clinic the project established to diagnose and treat sexually transmitted diseases. In 1993, the Calabar Project helped create a vocational and literacy training center to improve the women's ability to understand the complex issues related to HIV/AIDS and to give the women a way to supplement their income and improve their self-esteem. By this time, more than 60% of the women reported using condoms for all sex acts."

The ever growing adolescent fertility rate (111-152/1000 from 1969-1989) contributed to this rapid growth. Further repeat pregnancies among adolescents remained high in the 1980's and ranged from 20%-28.6%, depending on the survey. Even though overall prevalence of pregnancy fell 15.4% between 1978-1984, it remained the same for the 15-19 year old group. Teenage births have made up at least 35% of total deliveries. 1985 data revealed that even though adolescents represent 11-35% of the total obstetric population, problems ranked high among them: 38% of all eclampsia cases and high maternal mortality (102/100,000 vs. 57/100,000 older mothers). Studies showed that adolescents are sexually active, are ignorant about contraception, and do not use contraception. Yet contraceptive and family planning services are free in Kenya. Nevertheless the teenagers are at high risk of an unwanted pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and AIDS. In the early 1980s, Kenyatta National Hospital reported 53% of 74.1% of septic abortion cases being single women were between 14-20 years old. Similar results emerged from other studies. Health professionals believed these results to be underestimated, however. In the 1980s, 33% of all adolescents between 13-15 years old in a rural area had gonorrhea. In Kenyatta, 36% of pregnant 15-24 year olds had at least 1 STD while,e only 16% of those 24 years old did. Further, teenagers are especially vulnerable to psychological problems when they 1st learn of their pregnancy. Health services should be geared to meet the specific needs of adolescents, such as contraception education and antenatal services."

The percent lost to follow up was 12% for the NET-O EN group, 12% for DPMA users, and 0% for IUD and OC acceptors. The mean age of the acceptors was 30.4 years for NET-O EN, 30.7 years for DMPA, 28.3 years for OCs, and 25.2 years for IUDs. For these acceptor groups, the respective mean number of years of schooling was 6.1, 5.2, 7.2, and 7.5, and the respective mean number of pregnancies was 5.6, 5.4, 3.8, and 2.9. All 320 of the women were married, and 319 were Muslim. 99.4% lived in urban areas. 10% had no living male children, and 23.7% had no living female children. 2/3 of the injectable acceptors previously used 2 or more fertility control methods. A higher percent of IUD and OC acceptors, compared to injectable acceptors, reported using only 1 or no previous method. More than 1/2 of the injectable acceptors reported disruptions in their normal bleeding patterns. NET-O EN acceptors were more likely to experience heavy or prolonged bleeding while DPMA acceptors were more likely to report amenorrhea or a decreased flow. IUD acceptors were also bothered by bleeding problems. Almost all the women who reported changes in bleeding patterns were unhappy about the changes. Many of the women who reported amenorrhea worried that they might be pregnant. Women who experienced heavy or unpredictable bleeding worried about anemia and complained that bleeding interfered with their daily routines. 47.6% of the women reported weight gains, but this was generally viewed as an advantage. Nausea was the major side effect associated with OC use. 32% of the OC users, 28.0% of the NET-E ON users, 30.0% of the DMPA users, and none of the IUD users reported nausea. For all 4 groups, convenience and effectiveness were the major advantages the women attributed to their chosen method. Continuation rates were 68% for NET-O EN, 70% for DMPA, 75% for OCs, and 75% for IUDs. The major reason for discontinuation of injectables was bleeding problems. Among injectable users, a higher proportion of discontinuers (49%) than of continuers (20%) reported amenorrhea. The findings suggest that continuation for injectables could be improved if patients were given more detailed information about possible side effects and if they were advised to return to the clinic for treatment of any symptoms they experience."

        "abstract": "The preliminary results of the Liberian Demographic and Health Survey (LDHS), a survey of 5200 women aged 15-49 over the March to July 1986 period, indicate that the average Liberian woman has about 6.6 lifetime births and that there has been no recent decline in birthrate. Only 6.5% of the women in union were using a family planning method at the time of the survey; 52% of the women were using oral contraceptives (OCs), 17% had been sterilized, and 32% were using another modern method like the IUD or injectables. Women who were not married or in a stable union were more likely to be using a contraceptive, other than sterilization, than in-union women. 8.4% of all women surveyed were using a family planning method in 1986. The highest use rates were recorded among women with some formal education; 25% of the women in union with a primary or higher education were using a family planning method. 64% of the women in union had not had any formal education. The majority of women in union wanted another child, but about 33% preferred delaying their next pregnancy for at least 2 years. About 17% indicated they did not want more children. Many women mentioned fear of side effects and lack of availability or knowledge of methods as reasons why they did not use contraceptives. 1/3 reported they were not using a method because they were still breastfeeding their last child. A majority of children under age 5 had suffered with fever, diarrhea, or respiratory or other disease in the month prior to the survey. The types of treatment mothers administered for diarrhea varied from antibiotics and country medicine to nothing. Fewer than 10% had received oral rehydration salts. Almost 3/4 of the children suffering from fever had been given antimalarial drugs in the previous month."

        "abstract": "Because of the dramatic rise in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in Thailand, the Thai Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) started a biannual sentinel surveillance program of intravenous drug users, blood donors, pregnant women, and commercial sex workers (CSWs) in 1989. The Royal Thai Army (RTA) also began screening young men, who had been conscripted by lottery, for HIV-1 that year. The results of both programs indicated that the epidemic had spread beyond the traditional high risk groups into the general population. Since heterosexual transmission, particularly through CSWs, had been the principal source of HIV transmission, the government initiated a 100% condom use campaign and condom distribution program among CSWs and their clients. Condom use in men visiting CSWs increased from 50% in 1989 to 90% in June 1992, and the rates of sexually transmitted disease (STD) reported from public clinics declined. The RTA screening program screened 311,108 young men between November 1989 and November 1994; demographic data were collected between November 1991 and May 1993, and in November 1994. The prevalence of HIV-1 among conscripts nationwide increased from 0.5% in 1989 to 3.5% in 1992; it reached 3.7% in 1993, but decreased to 3.0% in 1994. Although decreases were observed among men of all educational levels, from all regions, the greatest decrease occurred among those from the upper North (from 12.4% in 1992 to 7.9% in 1994) where the prevalence had been the highest. This information needs to be considered when planning HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trials."

        "abstract": "Findings are presented from a prospective study of heterosexual HIV transmission in stable New Jersey couples serodiscordant for HIV infection and in which the uninfected partner is at risk solely from heterosexual contact. Between August 1990 and February 1992, 131 couples were interviewed at enrollment and 6-month follow-up, reporting their frequencies of vaginal, oral, and anal sex, with and without condoms, during the year before the negative partner learned of the positive partner's HIV infection, the month before baseline interview, and the interval between baseline and follow-up. A marked and significant decline was observed in couples' reported sexual activity and an increase in condom use after they first learned of their HIV serodiscordance. However, at the 6-month follow-up, the proportion who abstained from having sex declined from 33% to 21%, the proportion who practiced unsafe sex increased from 15% to 26%, and the proportion of couples who used condoms reliably was 53% at follow-up compared to 51% in the month before enrollment. Demographic characteristics, stage of disease in the HIV-infected partner, use of alcohol or drugs, and psychological state were correlates of unsafe sexual behavior after learning of HIV serodiscordance. The most important socioeconomic correlate of safe sex at baseline was employment of the female partner. People in stable partnerships may have greater difficulty changing well-established patterns of sexual behavior after one partner is found to be infected with HIV."

        "abstract": "The Bulawayo City Council Health Services Department launched a peer education program for sex workers in 1990. It consisted of formal meetings, informal outreach, condom distribution, and strengthening of sexually transmitted diseases services. Assessment was built in from the start in the form of monitoring, process ethnography, and outcome evaluation. 153 female prostitutes and 74 male sex clients were interviewed at baseline; follow-up interviews were held 1 year later with 48 prostitutes and 58 clients. These interviews revealed that 90% of women and 50% of men had attended program health education meetings; 96% of women and 69% of men had received condoms from the program; and condom use increased significantly among both men and women, although potential errors in the outcome data and their interpretation are acknowledged. The younger, better-educated women fluent in English initially recruited as peer educators were resented by older, less-educated women from rural areas. Attrition was also problematic among younger women as they left the business to enter other forms of employment and marriage. The most effective training proved to be practical, field-oriented, job-related, and frequently repeated and reinforced; regular field supervision was important. Further, the program found that interventions must discourage dependency among participants and instead promote cohesive, self-reliant groups. All people who are even remotely involved in such programs must be sensitized. This program is being replicated in other areas of Zimbabwe as well as in Siavonga, Zambia."

O objetivo deste trabalho foi apresentar resultados do primeiro estudo representativo de uma amostra nacional de pacientes psiquiátricos sobre a prática do sexo desprotegido e seus fatores associados. Uma amostra representativa de pacientes adultos com transtornos mentais foi aleatoriamente selecionada de instituições públicas de saúde mental no Brasil. Dados sociodemográficos, comportamentais e clínicos foram obtidos por entrevista face-a-face e sangue foi coletado para exames sorológicos. Foi utilizada regressão logística para análise estatística. A prevalência da prática do sexo desprotegido ao longo da vida foi de 80,3%. Pacientes casados/em união, mais velhos e do sexo feminino, aqueles com múltiplos parceiros e morando somente com filhos ou com parceiros e aqueles com condições psiquiátricas menos graves praticaram o sexo desprotegido mais frequentemente. A avaliação de comportamentos de risco é um instrumento crítico para que profissionais de saúde sejam capazes de determinar as necessidades de cuidados relacionados ao HIV para seus pacientes garantindo o acesso ao tratamento e prevenção. Intervenções que abordam situações de risco na vida dos pacientes psiquiátricos – institucional ou individual – e que contribuam para sua capacidade de tomar decisões informadas sobre sua saúde sexual são urgentemente necessárias."

The kit consists of a number of modules and exercises from which the presenter can choose what to present and make adjustments depending upon students' needs and the values of that community. The author evaluated the kit's impact upon secondary school students' intentions to adopt HIV/AIDS risk reduction behavior, their knowledge of AIDS, and their attitude toward people with AIDS. The program was presented to 339 students in standards 6-9 in 11 schools. The program was evaluated using a questionnaire before and after the program, as well as by focus group discussions with students and interviews with the program presenters. Although the program was not presented in ideal circumstances, it still positively affected students' knowledge of AIDS, their attitudes toward people with AIDS, and some aspects of their behavioral intentions. Students gave favorable evaluations of the program and offered suggestions on how to improve it with regard to the content, presenter, educational techniques, the role of parents, and how to address moral issues. AIDS education should form part of long-term life skills and sex education, with a focus upon behavioral change. Community education and participation are important elements in making school-based AIDS education programs effective."

        "abstract": "Since behavioral research indicates that assumption of less risky sexual practices is unlikely, prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) by alteration in contraceptive practice is more realistic. Condoms, known from laboratory tests to be impermeable to semen, body fluids, and all STD organisms except hepatitis B fragments, only reduce transmission of most STD infections by 50% in actual use. Those who use condoms more consistently achieve better protection, while condom failure due to breakage is concentrated among some users. Spermicides, including nonoxynol-0, benzalkonium chloride, menfegol, and octoxynol, act as lipid solvent, killing sperm and all STD agents. Most studies suggest about a 50% reduction in transmission, with perhaps a 33 less transmission of chlamydia. There is one report of possible enhancement of transmission of HIV by use of spermicides, among prostitutes in Africa. Neither condoms nor spermicides protect against extragenital transmission, especially for organisms transmitted by skin contact, i.e., syphilis, herpes, or chancroid. Oral contraceptives provide clear protection, about 50%, against pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), while they may facilitate cervical ectopy, and associated cervical chlamydia and gonorrhea. IUDs, once believed to heighten the risk of PID, now are considered increase this risk only a few days or months after insertion. Such insertion-related infection can be controlled with a single dose of a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Unfortunately those methods which are most effective in preventing pregnancy, pill and IUDs, are not particularly useful in preventing STDs, as are the less effective barriers and spermicides."

The current HIV/AIDS pandemic has made protecting against genital tract infection a high reproductive health priority. As awareness of HIV and other STDs has grown, decisions about contraceptive use have begun to involve the need to prevent STDs. Even though barrier methods are the only contraceptives currently recommended for STD/HIV prevention, many family planning providers are loath to recommend them because they have proven less reliable than some other forms of contraception in preventing unintended pregnancies. Some family planning clinicians worry that dependence upon only barrier methods will result in higher rates of both unintended pregnancy and HIV/STDs. The author considers the real-life effectiveness of male and female condoms in preventing pregnancy and STDs, the effectiveness of nonoxynol-9 agents against HIV/STDs, research progress in developing another female-controlled chemical barrier method, and the promotion of one method for preventing pregnancy and another for preventing HIV/STDs."

Specimens were taken of blood, endocervix, cervix, rectum and oropharynx, and tested for HIV, gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, hepatitis B and cytomegalovirus. 18% harbored gonorrhea, of which 13% were penicillinase positive. Syphilis occurred in 8%. Chlamydia was the most prevalent infection, in 47% of subjects. Serological evidence of hepatitis B was apparent in 53%, and of cytomegalovirus in 99%. HIV status was tested after unlinking identifying information from 80 serum samples, and 16% were confirmed HIV positive. Women from the site frequented by more street walkers than bar girls had a higher incidence of hepatitis B, and were known to be more frequent users of IV drugs.

High-risk behavior was reduced overall during the 36-month period from baseline to follow-up, although a subgroup of 104 either did not reduce or began high-risk drug and sex behavior over the period. Seroconversion of HIV antibody was highest among crack versus non-crack users, with the strongest predictor for conversion identified as prostitution. HIV infection rates are high in the Bronx among both IV and non-IV drug-using women, with cocaine use in any form viewed as a correlate of very high-risk heterosexual activity."

Most (79%) reported a very low level of the virus in their blood, 9.5% reported a detectable level, and 12% did not know their viral load in their blood. Of those with sexual partners, 19% did not know their partner's HIV status, 64% knew their partner was negative, and 22% knew they were positive. A total of 62% had told their partner about their HIV status. A total of 72% had sex before, and of those, 57% were sexually active in the last 3 months. A total of 68% of participants regularly used methods to prevent pregnancy. A total of 70% of participants said they had not experienced physical, sexual, or emotional violence in a relationship. In general, young people with HIV in the study knew a lot about their viral load and their partner's HIV status. There were low rates of violence between partners. However, there were some gaps in knowledge about preventing pregnancy and sharing HIV status, so it is important to include these topics more in education and support programs for young people with HIV."

Women with clinically evident causes of preterm labor like incompetent os, hydramnios, twins, and antepartum hemorrhage were excluded. Cases with abnormal presentations were also excluded. These patients knew their last menstrual period. Detailed history of any symptoms of lower genital tract infection was requested. 79.29% of the women were between 20 and 29 years of age. Both primigravidas and multigravidas were included. Out of 42 women with history of regular coitus during pregnancy, 17 women (40.48%) had preterm onset of labor, while 30 out of 98 (30.61%) had preterm onset of labor. There was no difference in the behavior of primigravidas and multigravidas. However, it was found that women who had coitus and symptoms of lower genital tract infection had a significantly higher incidence of preterm labor (46.88%) as compared with women with sexual activity but without such symptoms (20.O%) (p 0.005). When symptomatic women with positive sexual activity and negative coital history were compared, the incidence was similar: 46.88% and 48.07%, respectively. However, when symptomatic women with a positive history of sexual activity were compared with asymptomatic women without sexual activity, the occurrence of preterm labor was significantly more in the positive group: 20% vs. 10.87% in the negative history group (p .05). The significantly higher increase in preterm labor in women who had symptoms of lower genital tract infection and coitus implies that semen rather than coitus may affect the onset of labor. Further studies are required to learn more about this observation."

        "abstract": "The 1997 World AIDS Campaign has \"Children Living in a World of AIDS\" as its theme. This campaign reflects the fact that children today face new problems that are a direct result of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in addition to a multitude of other problems caused by poverty and other social ills. The AIDS epidemic has highlighted the need to discuss AIDS-related topics more openly with young people and to be nonjudgemental and to appreciate the circumstance of people's lives that may make it impossible to adopt sexual abstinence until marriage. Adults must create an environment in which children feel free to communicate their concerns and fears, especially during adolescence. This can occur if adults listen to children, talk with them instead of at them, admit the limits of their knowledge, and try to answer their questions. Adults must also support efforts to make reproductive health information and services more accessible to young people. Politicians who stand in the way of such accessibility must recognize that young people today will be the voters of tomorrow. Politicians, therefore, must not bow to special interest groups instead of acting out of a genuine concern for young people. Denial of access to a product, such as a condom, that may help protect people from unwanted pregnancy or disease is denial of a basic consumer (and human) right."

        "abstract": "<b>Antecedentes:</b> La opresión sistémica, en particular hacia las minorías sexuales, sigue estando profundamente arraigada en los cimientos de muchas sociedades a nivel mundial. Las experiencias con los factores de estrés de las minorías (por ejemplo, la discriminación, los delitos de odio, la homonegatividad interiorizada, la sensibilidad al rechazo y las microagresiones o humillaciones cotidianas) se han relacionado sistemáticamente con resultados adversos para la salud mental. La elucidación de las adaptaciones neuronales asociadas con la exposición al estrés de las minorías será fundamental para avanzar en nuestra comprensión de cómo las minorías sexuales se ven afectadas de manera desproporcionada por las cargas de salud mental.<b>Métodos:</b> Siguiendo las directrices PRISMA, revisamos sistemáticamente los estudios de neuroimagen publicados que comparaban la dinámica neural entre las poblaciones de minorías sexuales y heterosexuales, agregando la información relativa a cualquier medición del estrés de minorías y los fenómenos clínicos relevantes.<b>Resultados:</b> Sólo 1 de los 13 estudios elegibles para su inclusión examinó directamente el estrés de las minorías, mientras que todos los demás estudios se centraron en investigar las bases neurobiológicas de la orientación sexual. En nuestra síntesis narrativa, destacamos temas importantes que sugieren que la exposición al estrés de las minorías puede estar asociada con la disminución de la activación y la conectividad funcional dentro de la red del modo por defecto (relacionada con el sentido del yo y la cognición social), y resumimos la evidencia preliminar relacionada con la dinámica neuronal aberrante dentro de la red de saliencia (involucrada en la detección de amenazas y el procesamiento del miedo) y la red ejecutiva central (involucrada en el funcionamiento ejecutivo y la regulación de las emociones). Es importante destacar que esto es paralelo a las adaptaciones neuronales comúnmente observadas entre los individuos con trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) después del trauma y apoya la inclusión de formas insidiosas de trauma relacionadas con el estrés de las minorías dentro de los modelos de TEPT.<b>Conclusiones:</b> En conjunto, el estrés de las minorías puede tener varias vías neuropsicológicas compartidas con el TEPT y los trastornos relacionados con el estrés. Aquí, esbozamos una agenda de investigación detallada que proporciona una visión general de la literatura que vincula el estrés de las minorías sexuales con el TEPT y el trauma insidioso, el afecto moral (incluyendo la vergüenza y la culpa), y el riesgo/resiliencia de la salud mental, además del estrés de las minorías relacionadas con la raza, la etnia y el género.

        "abstract": "The deeply rooted tradition of widow inheritance is a determinant of sex among the Luo which is widely practiced by Luo groups in Uganda, Tanzania, Zaire, and Sudan. This practice of sexual networking whereby men who inherit widows have multiple sex partners, high frequency of exchange between widows, and low levels of condom use, however, encourages the spread of HIV. The authors interviewed 92 widows of mean age 34 years to investigate this traditional behavior among the Luo in South Nyanza District, Kenya. Subjects were widows of Luo men who had died of a chronic illness between November 1991 and October 1992. 47 had already been inherited and 34 were planning to be, while 11 refused to be inherited for fear of spreading HIV. Of the men who inherited them, 80% were married, one third had histories of inheriting other widows, and some were paid to take on their new responsibilities. Only two widows reported ever using condoms since the demise of their spouse even though sexual intercourse is an essential component of widow inheritance. The lack of condom use corresponds with the lack of knowledge about the ability of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV; only 9% reported being aware of this condom attribute. 87% of the widows, however, reported that sexual intercourse with multiple partners can lead to the transmission of HIV. 70% felt that monogamy and avoiding prostitutes can prevent the spread of HIV. These findings point to the urgent need for community based AIDS education targeting elders, women, and youth."

A total of 3805 respondents (52% female, 48% males) were included in the final analysis that consisted of 1506 Black students and 2299 White students. The findings showed that a significant number of public high school students are engaging in sexual intercourse. Black males had the highest percentage (88%) engaging in sexual intercourse, followed by Black females (70%), White males (61%), and White females (52%). Furthermore, an increased number of sexual intercourse partners were correlated with certain risk behaviors that place adolescents at risk for unintended pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, and other sexually transmitted infections. The strongest predictors of an increased number or sexual partners for White females were alcohol, tobacco, marijuana use, and dating violence; Black females had similar predictors with the addition of physical fighting. For White males, alcohol, tobacco, marijuana use, physical fighting, carrying weapons, and dating violence were the strongest predictors of an increased number of sex partners. Black males have similar predictors with the addition of binge alcohol use. These findings suggest the need for a comprehensive prevention program that focuses on adolescent behavior changes and environmental modifications."

        "abstract": "This study examines knowledge on AIDS, condom attitudes, and sexual behavior in a sample of 193 substance-abusing juvenile offenders on probation or parole in Mississippi. The participants were paid US$10 to complete self-administered questionnaires containing items regarding the adolescent's value, parental disciplinary practices, locus of control, condom attitudes, AIDS knowledge, sexual behavior frequency for the previous 6 months, where and from whom they obtained information about sex, perception of personal AIDS risks, and their self-efficacy in avoiding HIV infection. The majority of these youths reported being sexually active, and many admitted to early onset of sexual activity as well as unsafe sexual practices. The findings also support those of others, which reports that delinquents are likely to engage in behaviors, which place them at high-risk for HIV infection and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Other important findings emerged regarding condom use by juvenile offenders: positive attitudes towards the use of condoms and condom use at first intercourse predict subsequent condom use. These findings are particularly relevant to the development of AIDS prevention programs with juvenile offenders having found no relationship between levels of awareness, knowledge, or concern about HIV/AIDS and risky sexual behavior. Further, juvenile offenders are unlikely to abstain from sexual activity, and once they are sexually active, consistent condom use will lower their chances of contracting HIV infection and STDs. It is therefore of paramount importance that interventions be designed and implemented in an attempt to reduce these odds."

Black students were more likely than White students to report being sexually experienced, being currently sexually active, and having had 4 or more lifetime sex partners. The median age reported for first intercourse was 16.5 years in all years. In 1995, the median age at first intercourse was 15.0 years among Blacks, 16.2 years among Hispanics, and 16.7 years among Whites.

This study used data from the 4390 heterosexual Hispanics interviewed as part of the 1990-91 National AIDS Behavioral Survey to determine the prevalence and demographic correlates of HIV antibody testing and condom use among Hispanics at risk for HIV. Overall, 16.4% of respondents reported an HIV risk factor, primarily two or more sexual partners in the last 12 months (64%) or a high-risk main sex partner (26%). Those at risk tended to be highly acculturated unmarried males aged 18-29 years of European Spanish, South American, or Caribbean origin, with more than 12 years of education, an annual income under US$10,000, and infrequent church attendance. 35.3% of these high-risk persons had been tested for HIV; male gender and middle-income status were the strongest predictors of testing. Condoms were used at least half the time with a primary partner by 22.4% and with secondary partners by 44.7%, with higher use rates among acculturated Hispanics. The low prevalence of condom use and HIV testing among high-risk Hispanics underscores the need for campaigns that reinforce the acceptability of condom use as a social norm. Because US Hispanics are a heterogeneous group, such campaigns should target specific subgroups, including different national origins and levels of acculturation."

AIDS has been reported in all countries except British Virgin Islands and Montserrat (excluding Bermuda and Puerto Rico). Cuba is the only country with a national survey: 147 cases out of 1 million were reported seropositive. Expressed by prevalence, AIDS is highest in the Bahamas (229/100,000), French Guiana (84.0), ranges between 17.5 and 16.0 in Barbados, Trinidad/Tobago, Guadeloupe, and Haiti, and least in the Dominican Republic (3.2). AIDS first appeared in Haiti in 1979. Examination of hospital records for Kaposi's sarcoma, and tests of frozen sera have failed to find evidence of HIV infection before that date. The magnitude of the epidemic is difficult to define because many countries have no national register. The 1st CDC case definition does not apply well to tropical areas. It is estimated that rates will rise 30% with application of the new CDC definition. Initially AIDS was spread primarily by homosexual contact among bisexual males, but since 1983, it has spread by heterosexual means in Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Trinidad, the 3 countries with the highest number of reported cases. In Haiti, heterosexual spread between couples occurred in 26% of females and 27% of males over 24 months. Reports of AIDS among women have doubled between 1979-1982. Perinatal spread is 30-40%, but transmission by breastfeeding has not been documented."

        "abstract": "Health workers in several areas of the world have tried to reduce the spread of sexually transmitted diseases by treating everyone in the targeted group even if they do not exhibit symptoms. In 1981-1982, health workers treated prostitutes regularly in Nairobi, Kenya to curtail gonorrhea. Some researchers believe that mass treatment to control chancroid is more viable since the genital ulcers grant HIV a pathway. In fact, an epidemiologist with AIDSTECH believes chancroid and syphilis are the most promising diseases for testing and evaluating selective mass treatment. Between 1952-1969, health workers administered single doses of penicillin to 50 million people infected with yaws in 45 countries. These WHO and UNICEF sponsored global campaigns almost eradicated it, but it reappeared recently. Further health workers regularly treat prostitutes in some areas of Indonesia with penicillin. In 1976-1977, health workers treated several hundred migrant farm workers and prostitutes in California to prevent the spread of syphilis. In 1 year, syphilis fell 27% among the migrants and 51% among the prostitutes. Further, the 2nd year of the campaign, health workers tried more diligently to find cases, yet there were fewer reported syphilis cases. In Greenland, during the 1960s, the results of small scale mass treatment for gonorrhea (penicillin and probenecid) were not as promising as the California results, however. Gonorrhea prevalence fell from 10-1% in 6 months, but it climbed again after mass treatment ended. 1 problem with mass treatment is cost. For example, 1 injection of ceftriaxone to treat chancroid costs US$7. Other problems include side effects, drug resistance, and increased susceptibility to other infections. Issues to consider for mass treatment are the degree of a disease's infectiousness and the ability to control it with a single dose."

Topics include the nature of environmental factors affecting reproductive health, environmental factors blamed for declining sperm quantity and quality, the effects of natural and man-made disasters on reproductive health, chemical pollutants, how the environment damages reproductive health, and research needs for better research methodologies and surveillance data. Recommendations are made to: 1) promote international research collaboration with an emphasis on consistency of methodological approaches for assessing developmental and reproductive toxicity, on development of improved surveillance systems and data bases, an strengthening international disaster alert and evaluation systems; 2) promote research capabilities for multidisciplinary studies, for interactive studies of the environment and cellular processes, and for expansion of training and education; and 3) take action on priority problems of exposure to chemical, physical, and biological agents, of exposure to pesticides among specific populations, and of inadequate screening methods for identification of environmental chemicals. The costs of environmental injury to reproduction include subfertility, intrauterine growth retardation, spontaneous abortion, and various birth defects. Developed country's primary threats are from chemical pollution, radiation, and stress. There is a large gap in knowledge. Caution is urged in understanding the direct relationship between environmental causes and infertility. Sexual health is difficult to assess and research is suggested. Exposure to excessive vitamin A and toxic chemicals are cited as agents probably having serious effects on malformations. Sperm quality has declined over the decades; there is speculation about the potential causes. The effects of radiation such as at Chernobyl are described. Toxic chemical exposure such as in Bhopal, India killed thousands. Neurological damage is reported for fetuses and infants exposed to methyl mercury. There is the beginning of evidence that complications of pregnancy may be related to pollution levels surrounding industrial plants. Reproductive health is affected through chromosome damage and cell destruction, prenatal death, altered growth, fetal abnormalities, postnatal death, functional learning deficits, and premature aging."

        "abstract": "Considered opinion is that multiple indicators must be used to evaluate a project's success in slowing HIV transmission. There may be difference only over which is the best measure. The 4 indicators recommended for availability, accuracy, and usefulness are 1) reported condom use, 2) reported number of sexual partners, 3) condom sales, and 4) incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STD's). These measures are workable during program start-up, ongoing program implementation, and concurrent with evaluation. Methodologies employed for data collection are quantitative methods such as surveys and qualitative methods such as in-depth interviews or focus groups, direct observation or medical data from clinical exams, tests, or medical records. Reported condom use, albeit a surrogate measure, may be more valid when the questions asked about condom use during the last sex act, or a 1-week recall. Another reliability check would be to compare consistency with actual use in a focus group or reports from peer educators. Change in number of partners is important for intervention projects in STD clinics, workplace, or other social settings. The example given is for Trinidad's KAP surveys which measure changes in numbers of partners, condom use, and condom sales or distribution figures. Condom sales data, rather than free distribution figures, reflect a commitment to using condoms, and frequently condom use is already part of AIDS campaigns. Free condoms if part of a peer education project are more useful. In Mali, 82 prostitutes reported using 62,000 condoms while 58,000 were distributed in a month period. This is close enough to validate the data. STD rates are important measures because of the finding that STD's can increase the chance of HIV transmission by up to 100 times in a single act of intercourse. The number of STD cases can be substituted for costly incidence data."

Several recent studies conclude that the frequency of this behavior is a significant independent predictor of HIV seropositivity. It is probable but unknown whether women having receptive anal intercourse with bisexual men are at a greater risk than those with heterosexual partners. Reading the literature reveals a distinct ethnocentrism in the western medical profession that relegates this practice to homosexuals. A review o anecdotal data, survey data, and magazine and popular surveys indicates that the behavior is common. There are problems with ambiguous terminology, distinguishing receptive sex from anorectal stimulation or rear entry vaginal intercourse. Data on rectal STDs, usually thought to be due to poor hygiene in women, suggest as high as 20-29% solely rectal infections. The conservative conclusion is that 10% of American women engage in anal intercourse regularly. Although the number of women in this risk group of HIV transmission to other partnersis high, female-to-male transmission of HIV is not considered as likely in Western countries as is male-to-male transmission."

Since Nepali women are considered more beautiful and very young ones are considered virginal and free of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), the girls command a higher price. However, 1 survey in Bombay indicated that 50% of female prostitutes were infected with HIV. Caste prostitution also exists; among the Bhadi, the women are traditionally sex workers whose earnings support the whole community. The girls (usually the daughters of clients, raised by their single mothers), after being trained by their mothers, begin work at menarche with great ceremony, suffer no social isolation, and retire back into the community. Few marry because men outside the caste do not marry former sex workers and men inside the caste only marry girls from families with at least 3 daughters in order to protect the income to the community. 70% of these Bhadi workers are infected with STDs, but HIV has not made significant inroads. The Nepali prostitutes returning from Indian brothels and the seasonal migrant workers who use their services introduce HIV to a broader range of communities in Nepal. Conventional prevention programs that focus on teaching prostitutes to tell clients to use condoms and how to negotiate this, will fail; the children are in no position to do so. They are considered free of disease by clients who see no need to use condoms and command too high a price as \"virgins\" for brothel owners to disturb the situation by requiring condom use. Control efforts to stop trafficking have not been successful and do not have priority among the country's many survival needs. A comprehensive, culturally specific approach to HIV prevention is needed that includes education of clients and brothel owners about condom use, and community-based residential facilities for daughters of caste workers so that they may attend school and delay entry into sex work. Finally, the status of women must change, so that they are considered autonomous individuals who can make their own decisions."

It is estimated that unsafe/illegal abortions accounted 54% of all direct obstetric deaths. Studies have shown that unsafe illegal abortion is rampant among single women, teenagers, students, and factory workers. This trend clearly demonstrates that the country still lags behind in delivering family planning services due to infrastructural and policy constraints that impede effective service delivery. Given the political commitment and support of the government, focus on improving the status of women through education, employment, and health becomes the most serious undertaking. The outcome of such action will be the key solution to the empowerment of women and in reducing the high abortion rates. In addition, improving availability and accessibility of family planning services in working areas and institutions and ensuring availability of trained manpower to render essential services is necessary. The role of nongovernmental organizations, private sectors, women's associations, and the community is vital in promoting successful programs in family planning."

        "abstract": "Family planning (FP) professionals and programs are increasingly called upon to respond to increasing rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and AIDS. While structural and ideological readjustment to meet these demands may seem problematic for some programs, the AIDS epidemic allows the opportunity for programs to expand into preventive health activities. Dr. Nancy Williamson, Director of Family Health International's Division of Program Evaluation and 1 of the authors of the World Health Organization's guidelines on family planning and AIDS, responds to questions most frequently posed by FP providers considering the need for and process of FP program restructuring. She holds that programmatic expansion for the prevention of HIV infection enhances the capability to provide good contraceptive services. FP programs are not expected to abandon their central missions of preventing unwanted pregnancies, but to engage in both the prevention of STD infection and unwanted pregnancies where possible. Sharing responsible sex behavior and the condom as common means of prevention, these 2 missions are far from mutually exclusive. The AIDS epidemic has impacted upon FP programs in a number of ways. Increased demand for condoms has been observed in countries with high levels of HIV seropositivity, greater concern has been placed upon counseling and sterile procedures, view have been altered to accept this dual role of contraception, and universal precautions for the protection of both client and workers from infection are of greater importance. Promoting the consistent use of condoms for the prevention of STDs has proved more challenging than promoting for contraceptive uses. Gaining the legitimacy of condoms among married couples while they are also promoted among high-risk groups also remains difficult. On other issues, promoting the routine use of 2 temporary methods is not recommended, questions must be posed to determine clients' risk status for infection, counseling and services should be provided to those HIV+, and alternative funding sources may need to be sought for FP program expansion. Arguments for and against such expansion are discussed. Most of sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, and Thailand are in most serious need of programmatic changes, India and most of Central and South American need some changes, and other areas would benefit from minor changes. Dr. Williamson finally considers how programs should be modified, changes made thus far by programs, and suggests what programs may do to enhance their capability to provide contraceptive services."

About 20% of those who did discuss contraception or STDs did so only after having sex. While teens know generally about contraception and preventing pregnancy and STDs, they do not have enough detailed information about the various method options, how to use them, where to get them, and STD-related symptoms. Teen patients need to be assured that their information will remain confidential. Indeed, confidentiality can play a key role in encouraging teens to seek pregnancy prevention services and methods, as well as STD diagnosis and treatment, especially with regard to HIV testing. A randomized controlled trial of teens in 3 California public high schools found that when teens are assured of physician confidentiality, they are more willing to disclose sensitive information on sexuality and other issues, and to return for future health care. Finally, teens and young adults are least likely to have health insurance, even though providing such protection would offer cost savings in both public and private sectors."

Como parte de un estudio epidemiológico, 500 HSH fueron reclutados a través del método de Muestreo Dirigido por los Participantes (en inglés RDS) en el área metropolitano de Buenos Aires, Argentina y contestaron una encuesta conductual computarizada. Una submuestra de 233 hombres de 18 a 25 años de edad fue analisada. Se concentró en estratos socioeconómicos más bajos y sólo el 16% se identificaron como gay. Casi la mitad de la submuestra reportó haber tenido parejas sexuales masculinas, femeninas y travestíes. El uso de sustancias fue común, desde 61% consumidores de marihuana hasta 20% sulfato de cocaína (<i>pasta base</i>). El 70% de la muestra nunca se había hecho una prueba para el VIH: 3% resultaron positivos para VIH y 8% para sífilis en el transcurso del estudio."

        "abstract": "In rural Appalachia in Tennessee, data on 13 female adolescents who had experienced a pregnancy (mean age=16 years, 7 months) were compared with those on 38 female adolescents who had not experienced a pregnancy (mean age-16 years, 4 months) to test the hypothesis that teenagers who experience a pregnancy have external attributions of control over their life events. The Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale for Children was administered to determine their beliefs about causes of events in their lives. All the girls were white and matched for socioeconomic status, housing, and cultural background. The mean attribution of control to external agents score stood at 14.5 for girls who had experienced a pregnancy compared with 12.7 for those who had not experienced a pregnancy, but the difference was not significant (p=.08).54% of the cases exhibited external attributional orientation compared with 16% of the controls (p.02). This finding concurred with that of earlier studies. The fact that not all the girls who had experienced a pregnancy had external attributional orientation suggested that it is not the only factor linked to adolescent pregnancy. Studies have not identified whether external attributional orientation is a causal factor or consequence of adolescent pregnancy. A 1980 study found that women who had shown more external locus of control scores during pregnancy and tended to castigate themselves had a high probability of postpartum depression. Another study indicated that rises in depression among adolescents were linked to prechange orientations toward external attributions of control. Practitioners should selectively pay attention to teenagers who have extreme attributional orientations since many teenagers carry their pregnancies to term and choose to rear their infants. These orientations appear to pose risks for the adolescent mother and her children."

        "abstract": "In 1991, 772 male and female students at the University of Hawaii returned a questionnaire as part of a follow-up study to 1974 and 1979 surveys to examine their current sexual and contraceptive behavior and to compare this behavior with that in 1974 and 1979. Men were less likely to respond to the questionnaire than women (32 vs. 45.4%). 84.3% engaged in sexual activity compared to 69.55% in 1974. Mean age at first intercourse was 17.8 years. 66% of the students surveyed in 1991 experienced first intercourse before age 19, as compared to 44% in 1974 and 54% in 1979. Oral contraceptives (OCs) were the leading contraceptive method for 1974, 1979, and 1991 among all students (34.8, 32.6, and 30%, respectively). Condoms were the second most popular method for 1974 and 1991 and their use increased (18 and 28.4%, respectively). More students in 1991 either did not use any contraception or relied on withdrawal during first sexual intercourse than students in 1974 (43.9 vs. 40.9%). The main reasons for not using contraception included preference (21.7%), embarrassed (10.7%), and \"feel prepared\" (10.1%). 63.5% of students had just one sexual partner in the past year. 15.2% of women and 23.8% of men had more than 10 sexual partners. More women than men had been raped (21.6 vs. 13.3%). Most rapes in women were committed by someone they knew (e.g., partner, date, or relative). Just 3.3% of women who had suffered from rape were violated by a stranger. Almost 50% of students asked their partners about their sexual history before engaging in sexual intercourse. 10.7% of women and 7% of men asked their partner to be tested for HIV. Yet, neither request for sexual history nor HIV testing was associated with HIV/AIDS and condom use. 21% of women and 16% of men had a sexually transmitted disease (STD). 22% of women and 36% of men had been tested for HIV antibodies. 2 men were HIV positive. These findings showed that knowledge about STDs and HIV/AIDS did not significantly change sexual behavior, especially behavior leading up to first intercourse."

        "abstract": "In 1991, researchers followed 212 mothers and infants who tested HIV-1 negative at delivery in Rwanda. Later 8 infants tested HIV positive. Both the infants and mothers became infected simultaneously. They ruled out other routes of infection and concluded that the colostrum and breast milk were possibly the route of infection for 4 infants and positively the route for 4 infants. They postulated that when one 1st becomes infected with HIV, one may have high levels of HIV in the blood and thus be more infectious in the time period between 1st contracting HIV and development of HIV antibodies. All the mothers were vulnerable to sexual exploitation because they were either unmarried or widowed or had absent husbands and unstable sexual partnerships. Thus the risk factor of economic and social instability enhanced their vulnerability to exposure to HIV. The researchers suggested that heal professionals should counsel HIV negative mothers who are at high risk about the possibility of transmitting HIV via breast milk if they happen to seroconvert. In some developing countries like Rwanda, no alternatives to breast feeding exist so the researchers advocated intervention studies to assess the efficacy and feasibility of alternative nutritional practices, such as wet nursing, for mothers at high risk of acquiring HIV after delivery. They did not conclude that already HIV infected mothers should not breast feed since research had not yet proved that infants acquire HIV from breast milk of infected mothers. In fact, other research showed that HIV positive infants who are breast fed live longer than bottle fed HIV infants. After publication of this study, WHO continued its commitment to promote, protect, and support breast feeding no matter what the HIV prevalence of a country is."

        "abstract": "The role of sexual behavior in the development of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) has not been adequately assessed. Nonetheless, clinical reports, the age structure of PID patients, and the striking association of the sexual revolution with increased rates of PID provide support for the hypothesis that the development of PID is clearly associated with sexual activity. Although flawed in design and method, several studies have suggested that multiple sexual partners are a significant risk factor for the development of PID. Other studies aimed at determining the effect of frequency of intercourse, timing of intercourse, and sexual life style have provided inconclusive results. The inaccuracy of clinical diagnosis of PID limits the reliability of the results of many studies. Other obstacles have included the failure to describe confounding variables in the selection of controls and the questionable reliability and validity of information gathered on sexual history. Researchers must aggressively pursue the study of PID in the context of all its risk factors, including sexual behavior, prior history of PID, race, socioeconomic status, and IUD use. The findings generated from such research would enable physicians to counsel patients on the risks of certain aspects of sexual behavior."

Young people face many problems at home, in school, in the community and nationally. In an interview with rural youth, majority reported of never receiving sex education from their parents and most often youth learn about sex and sexuality from other sources. On the other hand, family life education taught in secondary schools covers only simple facts and does not cover sexuality or sex. To solve this problem, the following strategies are suggested: parents must make sure that they are well informed about sexual health and must take the responsibility of answering fully and accurately the questions of their youngsters; religious groups should also inform young adults about sexual responsibility, and teachers must be trained in sexual education to impart accurate information to the students. In addition to the strategies already mentioned, it is important to recognize the efforts of grass root level organizations that voluntarily helped."

        "abstract": "The AIDS epidemic has, to date, had only a minimal impact in India; however, given the low health status of the population and the lack of adequate health care facilities, the emergence of AIDS on a wider scale would be devastating. India's human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity rate now stands at about 2-3/1000 people tested. In what is suspected to be a racially motivated move, the Government of India has embarked on testing all foreign students (most of whom are from Africa) for HIV and is returning all those who test seropositive to their countries of origin. Of concern is the steady increase in HIV infection in professional blood donors (1.5/1000 in late 1988). Mandatory screening of donated blood is prohibitively expensive in India, and none of the 9 companies that manufacture blood products in India test their donors for HIV infection. Another concern is the finding that 1 of every 6 prostitutes in Bombay is infected with HIV. The response of the Indian Government to the AIDS threat has tended to be punitive toward AIDS victims rather than based on a sound preventive strategy. For example, the 1989 AIDS Prevention Bill forces individuals who are infected with HIV to reveal their past sexual partners, empowers authorities to hospitalize AIDS victims and drug addicts, and contains no provisions to protect the human and civil rights of AIDS victims. The mass media have treated AIDS in a sensationalized manner rather than presenting scientific information about the prevention and transmission of the disease. It is essential that the Government of India--and all world governments--realize that punitive measures will do little to reduce the spread of AIDS. Needed, instead, is a global prevention and control effort based on generosity and compassion."

CAMNAFAW's programs target young in-school and out-of-school people in urban and rural areas, offering lectures to adolescents on adolescent health at the organization's center every Wednesday afternoon. Topics such as AIDS, the relationship between boys and girls, and unwanted pregnancy are covered at the weekly sessions. Based upon discussions with participants at the seminars, adolescents perceive abortion and sexually transmitted diseases to be their most pressing problems. However, the youths believe that to effectively combat abortion, the root cause of unwanted pregnancy must be addressed. Adolescents have these reproductive health problems because they are not exposed to sex education and parents are particularly loath to discuss sex. It seems, however, that young people know that AIDS exists. CAMNAFAW's youth program is geared toward training youths so that they can teach their peers. The organization has been invited to address youth groups."

        "abstract": "White, U.S. homosexual males were primarily affected in the early stages of the AIDS pandemic. Some Western researchers argued, however, that the syndrome originated in Africa. Strong political and social response to this notion resulted in only an anemic response to the growing AIDS epidemic in Nigeria. Nonetheless, the Stop AIDS Organization finally launched the Motor Park AIDS Education Program (MPAEP) in 1988, for health and education outreach to populations at risk of STDs and HIV infection. Specifically targeted are long-distance truck drivers, their young male assistants known as motor boys, and the barmaids, prostitutes, and homeless juveniles who frequent motor parks where these drivers rest while on the road. Many of these long-haul drivers have unprotected casual and commercial sex, both homosexual and heterosexual, take drugs, and suffer high rates of STDs. Marginalized, 75% illiterate, and speaking a variety of languages, these populations tend to be largely ignorant of the incurable nature of AIDS. Over 45% of motor park populations are estimated to be infected with an STD, or to have a future re-infection. These drivers are optimal vectors for the spread of HIV both internationally and within Nigeria. MPAEP workers work 6 days/week in the larger interstate motor parks to reach out to their predominantly male customers. They meet a host of primary health needs, and refer STD clients for testing and treatment. Drug use and homosexuality are 2 topics of discussion especially taboo in African society which have nonetheless been vigorously researched by MPAEP. Many drivers are unacknowledged bisexuals who have sex with their motor boys. Workers therefore explain the need to use condoms in same-sex activity without specifically mentioning homosexuality. Many Nigerians deny the existence of HIV and AIDS, are reluctant to speak about sex, and consider MPAEP workers to be intruders. Despite opposition in Muslim- dominated Northern Nigeria, however, program efforts continue."

        "abstract": "This article provides a general discussion of a variety of different features of HIV infection and the not widely accepted concept of preconception counseling. The focus is on testing, counseling and counselors, infertility clinics, promotion of awareness, attitudes to HIV testing, education, parameters for counseling, the risk of coitus and the value of contraceptive usage in the presence of HIV, accurate and understandable information, attitudes of children, legal significance, and the effect of disaster on the family and relationships. The author is concerned with the need to provide testing facilities, and prepregnancy testing. The risk of HIV infection adds to the importance of planned pregnancy and counseling in family planning and selecting appropriate methods. Informed and responsible decisions require adequate consideration of all the issues and information currently available. Preconceptual counseling clinics tend to be small in number, but the health care professionals serving the population in need must be well educated in the knowledge of obstetrics and the behavior of HIV infection/AIDS. Infertility clinics are one potential source of contact with those at high risk of HIV. A national campaign to emphasize the need to seek advice on family planning for those at risk of HIV is necessary in countries where HIV is widespread. Preconception counseling is possible only after there is awareness of risk of HIV infection and the risks of pregnancy. Confounding policies for testing and counseling are attitudes of politicians and officials which may reflect the general welfare rather than individual welfare or public opinion and attitudes of pressure groups which may not reflect the general welfare. 2 issues are of concern: that risk by accurately assessed, and terms like safe sex avoided. The following understandable information needs to be provided; a woman's risk with an HIV positive husband, a woman's pregnancy risk, a father's risk with an HIV infected partner, the fetal risk (estimated at 30%), prognosis for an infected child, the effect on family of having an infected child, possible cures/effective treatment in the future, the effect of relationships and parents work/life, the possibility of an orphaned child or loss of a parent, adverse effects of factors on pregnancy, the relevance of any treatment, and children's welfare with harmful parent lifestyles. Counselors must be aware of the influence of race, religion, class, and the pressures in prostitution for unprotected sex. Legal issues may arise between parent and child, or in counselor negligence. Caring for a handicapped child and the nature of discrimination against those with AIDs must be approached openmindedly. An informed decision must be an available option."

Los resultados primarios incluyeron la gravedad del TEPT, el número de parejas sexuales, la frecuencia de las relaciones sexuales, las relaciones sexuales durante el consumo de sustancias y el consumo general de sustancias. Ambos tratamientos redujeron la gravedad del TEPT, la conducta sexual de riesgo, el número de parejas sexuales, los encuentros sexuales con parejas con estado serológico de VIH desconocido y los síntomas de consumo de sustancias en el seguimiento. Sin embargo, NET mostró mayor efectividad que MIST, específicamente en la reducción de las conductas sexuales de riesgo y el consumo de sustancias.

        "abstract": "In the Dominican Republic, 93% of female sex workers did not use condoms because of client refusal according to a survey. The organizations PROCETS and COIN carried out a project to learn why clients refused and to develop educational materials to assist sex workers. The project held 8 focus group discussions with 65 women and identified clients' most common arguments against condom use, compiled a list of successful strategies, and developed 5 profiles of clients: the executive, the smooth talker, the macho, the stubborn one, and the indomitable one. These typical clients were featured in a comic book with 5 stories in which Maritza, a clever sex worker, counters the men's refusal to use condoms and convinces 4 of them to do so. In the 5th story, she tells a young sex worker that she should refuse clients who do not want safer sex. The women participated in all stages of the comic book's development. The project then trained other sex workers to use the comic book in peer education and discussion to enhance the sex workers' sense of self-efficacy. In the first 2 months, peer educators distributed 2895 copies of the comic book to sex workers in 2 major cities. A follow-up survey is evaluating the comic's impact by comparing the women who read the comic with those who did not to determine correlations between self-efficacy and safer sex negotiation and condom use. In a 3rd stage, male clients will be approached so that appropriate interventions can be developed with them. The Maritza comic book has been used for a flipchart series to train on sexually transmitted diseases (STD) prevention. Some of the issues addressed include the uselessness of vaginal douches against STDs, the need to talk frankly with physicians about symptoms, the importance of using all medicines prescribed for treatments, and the incubation periods of diseases."

        "abstract": "A knowledge, attitude, belief, and practices survey was given to a sample of 591 residents of St. Lucia in the fall of 1990. The survey posed a host of questions relating to whether respondents were inclined to use condoms when having sex. Respondents were sexually experienced, aged 15-60 years, and interviewed in their homes. Questions were posed and viewed as possible indicators of AIDS knowledge, cues to action, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived locus of control, normative pressure, and condom use outcome expectancies. Statistical analysis suggests that each variable is related to condom use. Analysis also indicates that perceived normative pressure to use condoms was by far the single most important determinant of condom use among the sample. The author closes by discussing the implications of these findings for designing mass media campaigns to increase condom use and strongly recommends a normative campaign."

        "abstract": "Sexual partners who communicate about reproductive health issues reduce their risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted disease (STD) or of unintended pregnancy, but few couples feel comfortable talking openly about sex. AIDS prevention programs have focused on improving couple communication, but family planning programs have emphasized women-controlled contraception as more reliable than barrier methods. The effectiveness of barrier methods would likely improve, however, if clients are counseled in couple communication. Effective communication about sexual issues requires self-confidence, and strengthening a woman's self-confidence may also improve her ability to negotiate condom use. Small discussion groups held among female factory workers in Thailand in 1993-94 led to an increase from 60% to 90% in the number of women who felt confident in discussing STD risk with a partner and to an increase from 36% to 82% in those who said they would not be embarrassed to give a partner a condom. A Nigerian study also suggested that more education may also improve prospects for couple communication and contraceptive usage. A US study showed that adolescent women who communicated openly with their partners reduced their risks of unintended pregnancy and STDs, and a Kenyan study indicated that communication increases contraceptive usage among married couples. Various projects around the world are attempting to counsel women on communication and condom negotiation, and counselors are beginning the difficult task of teaching women how to convince men to use condoms."

These pills have fewer systemic side effects than combined pills but increased bleeding irregularities, possibly related to ovarian estrogen secretion. The 21 women and 21 controls were recruited from family planning clients at the Margaret Pyke Centre, London. Women with history of pelvic pain were excluded. The pills were levonorgestrel 30 mcg (6 women), norethisterone 350 mcg (8), and ethynodiol diacetate (7). Subjects received 3 ultrasound scans with an ALOKA SSD-720 scanner during 1 menstrual cycle. A functional ovarian cyst was defined as any fluid-filled structure 39 mm diameter that subsequently failed to rupture and form a corpus luteum. Functional cysts were seen in 8 of 21 women on the 1st scan. 15/21 failed to ovulate, and 12 of these had cysts.

Traditionally, the professional public health community has focused on secondary prevention of STDs -- detection and treatment of the disease in order to prevent complications from developing. But in light of the AIDS epidemic, greater attention has been paid to primary prevention. Hoping to prevent the disease from occurring, primary prevention efforts target high risk groups (prostitutes and their clients and young people) with health education and promotion of behavioral change. Such changes include using condoms, seeking medical care for STDs, and decreasing the number of sex partners. An example of primary prevention programs is the Avancemos Project in the Dominican Republic. Launched in 1989 by the country's Ministry of Health and Family Health International's AIDSTECH Division, the project targets sex workers with several intervention measures. Initially, the Avancemos Project trained 16 sex workers to serve as peer educators to distribute condoms and educational materials. These 16 volunteers have in turn trained more than 300 other peer educators. Among the educational materials distributed by the peer educators are 2 comic books entitled \"Martiza's Advice\" and \"The Triumphs of Maritza.\" A handsome, well dressed, and street-wise sex worker, the title character in these comic books instructs on a range of issues, including how to negotiate with clients how to use a condom. As those involved with the project attest, the comic books have become extremely popular among the target group, tapping into the women's buried feelings of self-worth."

It is time for lawmakers, judges, lawyers, policy analysts, lobbyists, and advocates to realize they cannot legislate or litigate how, when, or why people fall in love. Rather, the role of the law should be to create and preserve models of justice and equality that seek to preserve one's individual rights to privacy and freedom to choose in matters related to one's sexuality. This includes free access to age-appropriate sexuality information, the right to marriage and children regardless of sexual orientation, comprehensive sexuality education that encompasses information about avoiding unwanted pregnancies and HIV/STDs, access to contraception and abortion, protection from sexually abusive or exploitative relationships, and access to sexual health care."

Although respondents were highly knowledgeable about major modes of HIV transmission, one-third to one-half believed that HIV could be contracted from mosquito bites, public bathrooms, kissing, and the HIV test. Only 15% knew someone with AIDS. Ever-use of condoms was reported by 70.9% of men and 41.9% of women. Of the 68 subjects who had been sexually active in the year preceding the survey, 20 reported two or more partners. Among sexually active respondents, 16.2% always used condoms with their primary partner, while 43.0% used condoms consistently with occasional partners. 48.9% of men and 57.1% of women never used condoms with their primary partner; with casual partners, these rates were 30.8% and 44.4%, respectively. Worry about contracting AIDS, self-rated on a scale from 1 (very often) to 4 (never), averaged 2.84, with higher worry scores among those 18-31 years of age and with multiple partners.

The sample was comprised of 959 youth, most of whom were 14-18 years old at the time of the 1994 survey, who were the oldest child of the original female respondents. The analysis of risk behaviors was restricted to the 483 youth known to be sexually active. Compared to their non-sexually-active counterparts, sexually active youth had lower family incomes, mothers with lower educational attainment, and mothers who themselves became sexually active at a young age (mean, 15.5 years). Sexual activity at an early age was further associated with substance abuse, a view of oneself as a risk taker, and a history of running away from home. Early age at first coitus, nonuse of contraception, and adolescent childbearing were significantly linked with depression, feeling like a failure, and little sense of control over one's life in female respondents. In contrast, sexually active teen males reported low levels of depression and felt in control of their lives. After parenthood, tentative evidence of maturity emerged for both genders. Young mothers reduced their alcohol consumption and spent less time with peers who drank; young fathers exhibited lower levels of willingness to take risks, higher depression, and greater involvement in socially productive activities."

        "abstract": "668 Black, White, and Hispanic low-income women at 21 public health, sexually transmitted disease (STD), and family planning clinics or state economic service centers in Miami provided data on their sex behavior, drug and alcohol consumption, and condom use. The data were collected from September 1994 through February 1995. Any participant who reported having had sex with three or more partners in the preceding 6 months, exchanging sex for drugs or money in the preceding 6 months, or having a sex partner who they believe has had sex with men or had injected drugs was classified as a sexual risk-taker. Any woman who had taken any recreational drugs in the past 6 months or had drank alcohol before having sex over the same period was classified as a substance user. 19% of the women engaged in risky sex behavior over the preceding 6 months, 24% in substance use, and 31% in condom use. Overall, the substance users are almost 4.5 times more likely to take sexual risks than nonusers, and about half as likely to have used condoms. Substance users who take sexual risks seem just as likely to use condoms as nonusers who take sexual risks and those who do not. However, substance users who do not take sexual risks are far less likely to use condoms. This pattern holds among Black, White, and Hispanic women, and suggests that perceptions of risk and the risks that partners bring to sexual encounters may be more important determinants of condom use than substance use alone."

        "abstract": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that half of all HIV infections in the US occur among people under age 25 years. HIV infection is the 6th leading cause of death among people aged 15-24 years. There are also 3 million other cases of STDs among teenagers every year, and up to 1 million US teens become pregnant annually. Research conducted by the CDC has found that teens whose mothers discussed condoms with them prior to their first sexual intercourse were 3 times more likely to use them than were teens who never discussed condoms with their mothers or who did so only after their first intercourse. Findings are based upon interviews with 372 sexually-active teens aged 14-17 years in New York, Alabama, and Puerto Rico, more than two-thirds of whom had discussed condoms with their mothers. Early discussion also increased condom use during subsequent episodes of sexual intercourse. When condoms were used at first intercourse, adolescents were 20 times more likely to use them during future episodes of sexual intercourse."

They were followed up every month with clinical examination and treatment of STDs, provision of condoms, and CD collection. There were 52 WR, 27 DR, and 79 CD records collected from the participants. Results showed that CD records showed a significantly greater mean number of clients compared to the questionnaires (23.3 vs. 13.6, P 0.001), number of condoms used (2.7 vs. 0.5, P 0.001), vaginal acts (6.8 vs. 2.9, P 0.001), and anal acts (1.9 vs. 0.7, P = 0.044). Daily accounts of weekly sexual activity showed significant differences in 1) the number of days worked (6.2 vs. 5.2, P = 0.009), 2) the number of clients (21.7 vs. 17.4, P = 0.027), and 3) the number of anal acts with clients (3.9 vs. 0.8, P = 0.004), with higher means reported in the CD records for all cases. The CD records are an important instrument for gathering preliminary sexual behavioral information; however, their use is limited to long-term data collection. Therefore, a comprehensive recall questionnaire is recommended for future trials."

        "abstract": "A number of studies have demonstrated that when used consistently and correctly, both male and female condoms prevent unplanned pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). For example, in a study of US navy personnel who reported having vaginal intercourse with prostitutes who had a high prevalence of gonorrhea, none of the 29 men who reported using condoms during their sex acts contracted gonorrhea or nongonococcal urethritis. However, 14% of the 499 nonusers became infected. The preponderance of evidence from 10 studies of high-risk populations in 7 countries where both the level of condom use and HIV infection were prospectively measured showed the consistent use of male condoms to protect against HIV acquisition in the range of 50-100%. Additional evidence in support of condom use comes from two studies involving HIV-discordant couples. A European study of 123 such couples who consistently and correctly used condoms found that no HIV-uninfected partner became infected with HIV by their partners. Similarly, 1 of 42 seronegative partners in HIV-discordant couples in Haiti became infected with HIV after having consistently used condoms. In both of these studies, 7-14% of couples who used condoms either consistently or not at all became infected. Since the government of Thailand began promoting 100% condom use among prostitutes and their clients, there has been a decline in both the level of curable STDs reported to clinics and HIV prevalence among Thai military recruits. Male and female condoms are effective even under typical imperfect conditions, and their consistent use should be encouraged at every opportunity."

        "abstract": "This discussion of oral contraceptives (OCs) presents information on the following: types of steroidal contraception OCs, injectable contraceptive agents, implants, intravaginal rings, IUD bearing steroids, male pills, intracervical devices, contraceptive bracelets, and intranasal administration of hormones); guidelines for adolescent usage (why adolescents use OCs, common medical concerns, assessment, prescribing, educating for user effectiveness, and the length of time that the adolescent can use OCs); the marketing of OCs; attitudes toward OCs; the effect of OCs on insulin requirements in diabetes; mortality among OC users; assessing new knowledge of mortality trends and OCs; beneficial and adverse effects; sexual and psychological response to OCs; chromosomal abnormalities and OCs; ectopic pregnancies and the progestogen only pill; liver tumors and OCs; cancer and OCs; eye conditions and OCs; and postpill amenorrhea and infertility. Most adolescents choose OCs as their initial contraceptive method because it is probably the only method of which they have much knowledge. Most adolescents lack the needed level of sexual maturity and sexual sophistication to pause to insert a diaphrage or to use a condom. Another attraction of OCs is reliability. At this time 12 major companies based in 8 countries (excluding China) produce and market OCs. Basically either of 2 estrogens, ethinyl estradiol and mestranol, are used in combination with about 6 different progestogens. Attitudes vary greatly and range from total acceptance to total rejection. Despite some negative views about OC, 32.2% of Australian women in childbearing years are using OCs indicating a high degree of acceptance. The new data available indicate strongly that the hazards of using OCs are somewhat greater than previously suspected. In 1977 the Royal College of General Practitioners reported a death rate from circulatory disease which was in OC users 4.7 times that of women who had never used OCs. The deaths were concentrated among the older women, among cigarette smokers, and those with a long duration of OC use, i.e., over 5 years. Available evidence suggests that OCs do affect a number of transmitter amines in the brain and this might be responsible for the depressed mood in some patients. Critical review of the literature leaves one skeptical concerning claims of either positive or negative influences on the libido."

        "abstract": "The effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on women and children in African countries are perpetrated by heterosexual contact. Women's multiple role as sexual companions, wives, daughters, and mothers impact on the spread of the virus and also on the social and economic effects of the epidemic on family members. If premarital sex is tolerated and the age at onset of sexual activity is indistinguishable from the age at menarche, young females will become exposed to HIV very early in their lives. The probability of not becoming infected between ages 15 and 25 in 3 HIV infectivity regimes (assuming the age of 15 for onset of sexual activity) indicated proportionately larger gains in HIV regimes of higher infectivity. A reduction of 15 years in the age gap between partners in a regime with an intermediate infectivity leads to an increase of about 24% in the probability of avoiding infection. In contrast, in the regime with highest infectivity, the gains multiply the probability of remaining uninfected more than 10-fold. Although the growing incidence of orphanhood should affect male and female children alike, if mortality and female children are excessive in fosterage arrangements female children may be inflicted disproportionately. Unless massive social remedies mitigate the growing orphanhood, the rates of school dropout, child-labor participation and outright abandonment will increase. Increased adult mortality will also raise the incidence of widow(er)hood. Women can reduce the risk of HIV sexual partners. Increased adult mortality could induce and overhaul of family arrangements where female children, mothers, and grandmothers are likely to bear the bulk of the personal, social, and economic burden in the absence of social interventions."

Entertaining music videos convey accurate messages to target audiences more effectively than teachers and doctors are able. In addition to successes in the Philippines and Nigeria, overwhelming success has been met with Wait, a video with Latin American pop start Tatiana and Johnny. A hit in 11 Latin American countries reaching 1 in Mexico, the video received 1 million hour s free air time. Passionate, powerful, and persuasive, these videos have prompted increased contraceptive use in countries where they have been aired. The Center's videos and songs have proved popular and profitable in a competitive market of ideas, earning 3-4 times their production costs. Accordingly, health experts from Johns Hopkins University recognize the potential role of these productions in preventing AIDS and unwanted pregnancies in other settings. Where Baltimore leads the U.S. in teen pregnancies, the Center would like to air soap opera on sexual responsibility. Production costs in the U.S. are, however, 10 times higher than in developing countries. With the collaboration of media executives, significant financial and social rewards could result from such a production."

        "abstract": "Teenagers' communication with their partners about sex, an important factor in sexual risk reduction, has been shown to be influenced by discussions teens have with their parents about sex. The present study confirmed that parent-teen communication about sex does indeed promote teenagers' discussions with their partners about sex and condom use, but only when parents communicate in a skilled, comfortable, and open manner. Interviews were conducted during 1993-94 with 372 sexually active Black and Hispanic US high school students 14-17 years old from Alabama, New York, and Puerto Rico. On average, teens had first intercourse at age 13.7 years and had had 3.9 partners. The association between parent-teen discussions about sexuality and sexual risk and teenager-partner communication about sex was high when parental responsiveness (openness, skill, comfort) was rated high by the teenager, but this association was weaker and of only marginal significance when responsiveness was rated as low. Similarly, when parental responsiveness was high, sexuality and risk discussions were significantly associated with increased condom use during most recent intercourse and lifetime condom use. However, at low levels of parental responsiveness, sexuality discussions were negatively associated with most recent and lifetime condom use. The association between parent-teen communication and condom use was direct and independent. These findings highlight the importance of communication skills training for parents."

        "abstract": "Decision making and socialization models have advanced our knowledge of adolescent contraceptive behavior. They also show the vital role values, attitudes, and beliefs play in contraceptive use. A social work professor builds on these models and adds values, attitudes, and beliefs to a new social learning model of contraceptive behavior to improve on the weaknesses of those models. This new model considers contraceptive behavior an active response instead of a passive response. It uses 3 major components to explain how adolescents learn and preserve contraceptive behaviors. They include environmental context, cognitive influences, and behavior executive constraints. Accurate sexuality information, available contraceptive services, and availability of role models constitute the environmental context. These environmental factors either support or limit contraceptive use. Perception of need and consequences is a cognitive influence and embraces judgment of immediate and delayed consequences and probability and susceptibility to pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs); perception of pregnancy/STD seriousness; and expectation regarding personal mastery. The other cognitive influence is decision making processed which involved generating, evaluating, and selecting alternatives. Advantages of this model are its flexibility to apply it to different groups of adolescents and its emphasis on reducing the risk of acquiring an STD as well as pregnancy prevention. Researchers of contraceptive behavior among adolescents should consider all 3 model components when designing research that aims to predict birth control behavior."

        "abstract": "Since the first acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) case was confirmed in 1986, Senegal has conducted an aggressive prevention campaign. Senegal's National AIDS Committee has noted the contributions of poverty and migration to the spread of AIDS. By June 1994, 1297 AIDS cases had been reported and an estimated 500,000 people (1.4% of the population) were infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and 2. The highest rate of HIV infection (14%) exists among commercial sex workers. At present, HIV/AIDS cases are concentrated in Dakar, Kaolack, the Matam region, and Ziguinchor; however, the growing importance of inter-regional trading is expected to spread HIV to the smaller towns and rural areas. Also salient is the recent devaluation by 50% of the CFA franc, which has reduced the public sector workforce and led many poor urban residents into commercial sex work. CFA devaluation has made Senegal attractive to tourists and business visitors--another factor responsible for growth of the legalized commercial sex industry. Although sex workers are instructed in condom use and tested annually for HIV, only 850 of the 2000 registered sex workers have reported for check-ups, and the majority of prostitutes are unregistered. Senegal's AIDS Plan for 1994-98 focuses on care of AIDS patients, pressures placed on family structures by HIV, and AIDS-related erosions in the status of women. Each health service region has its own local plan for AIDS/HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, supervised by a regional committee. Public education has involved outreach to religious leaders, promotion of affordable condoms, and distribution of over 75,000 leaflets to key target populations. About US $16 million of the $25,688,875-budget HIV/AIDS program for 1994-98 was pledged by external donors."

Les améliorations sont survenues malgré l'absence de changement quant au degré de douleur à la pénétration ou au degré de fatigue entre le début et la fin de la thérapie. Les résultats au questionnaire d'évaluation du traitement ont montré que les femmes ont apprécié les connaissances et les techniques acquises en cours de route.

Our of all live births in the past decade, 39% occurred among adolescent mothers -- women 15-24 years of age. Evidence suggests that the share among girls 15-19 is growing. Furthermore, a recent survey indicated that the number of those engaging in premarital sex continues to increase. These developments signal increased health risks among adolescents. While the overall maternal mortality rate of the Philippines is 1/1000 women who give birth, the rate for women under 15 years of age is an astounding 490.5/1000. Girls who attempt to terminate the pregnancy through an induced abortion risk death or complications. And many girls who become pregnant are often forced into early marriages. In addition to early pregnancy and its associated health risks, adolescents face other serious problems. 1/5 of those infected with AIDS are in their 20s, meaning that they probably contracted the disease during adolescence. Adolescents are also at serious risk of contracting other STDs. Young men often have their first sexual encounter with prostitutes, and young women remain less informed than their male counterparts about STDs. Although sex education is compulsory in public schools, the courses are inadequate and hardly stressed. Because of the Catholic Church's opposition to family planning, the subject is rarely mentioned. The government has done little to promote family planning -- especially among adolescents. High adolescent fertility, however, poses a threat not only to young people but to the country as a whole, since nearly half the population is under 18 years of age."

        "abstract": "The course of HIV infection/AIDS and its impacts on society are affected by the conditions of underdevelopment. It is generally understood that HIV/AIDS affects development by the loss of trained manpower and the absorption of scarce social and economic resources. In underdeveloped countries, for instance the doctor:patient ratio is very high, i.e./ 1:34,000 in Rwanda, and inadequate facilities prevail, i..e., i Brazil, many AIDS service organizations are without telephones or other office equipment. Prevention strategies from developed countries may be inappropriate for developing countries. The cost of treatment may be greater than the institutional capability and compete with the availability of care for other illnesses. The social costs are in the health care system and in the economic and physical hardships of AIDS households. When governments are in a debt crisis or adjusting the economic system, social services are being reduced and scarcity of foreign exchange means basic medicines to treat complications of AIDS and equipment to detect HIV-infected blood may not be imported. HIV campaigns may be ineffectual in countries where there is a mistrust of government. Behaviors that place people at risk of HIV infection include low levels of education, crowded and unsanitary living conditions, limited access to health care, poor nutrition, and high rates of unemployment. Urban areas can place new rural migrants at risk, i.e., men separated from their families seeking prostitutes, or women with children and few employment skills turning to prostitution. Women must balance the desire for children with protecting themselves against HIV. Many women are unable to negotiate the use of condoms. Societies with taboos about talking about sexuality add to the difficulty. Popular, creative solutions are found in outreach efforts i popular music, children's HIV education programs, and the training of commercial sex workers in promoting condom use. There is a need for broad application of educational strategies compatible with cultural values and sensitive to community needs."

The MBL was comparable in the 3 populations with the mean of 35.1 +or- 12.6, 30.6 +or- 8.7 and 32.2 +or- 9.4 ml respectively. There was no difference of statistical significance between the 2 periods studied per each individual. This study objectively assesses the menstrual blood loss in 3 population groups--2 urban and 1 rural. The data can be used to evaluate menstrual blood loss before and after initiation of various contraceptives used in Kenya. Subjects were volunteers who were not on any contraception except barrier or natural rhythm methods, not under psychological stress and who exhibited normal physical female characteristics on examination. Those who wished to drop out, became pregnant or desired contraception, were excluded. The study confirms the individual constancy of the menstrual blood loss in this population. This has important practical implications since a single determination of the menstrual blood loss may be a fairly good expression for the average blood loss in a woman. The immediate effect of various treatments such as IUD insertion or oral contraceptives on the MBL may easily be evaluated quantitatively by measurements in consecutive periods using only 1 period as a control. The quick method can be easily used in evaluating pathological conditions e.g. iron-deficiency due to heavy bleeding, IUD-associated hemorrhage, menorrhagia and uterine fibroid."

HSH negros (vs. HSH no-negros) eran más propensos a no saber el estado serológico del VIH de su pareja (21.8% vs. 9.6%). Proporciones similares reportaron concurrencia de pareja sexual (67.1% vs. 68.0%). En análisis ajustados, entre HSH negros, la concurrencia de pareja sexual aumentó significativamente las probabilidades de una asociación potencial de transmisión del VIH (TPP por sus siglas en inglés), y esta asociación no fue significativa entre índices de no-negros. La asociación entre una TPP VIH y concurrencia de pareja sexual puede ayudar a explicar disparidades raciales persistentes en la prevalencia del VIH."

        "abstract": "The impact of an HIV testing and counseling program on the risk behaviors of drug users was assessed in 981 African American heroin and crack cocaine users living in the US and 144 Puerto Ricans living both in Puerto Rico and the US. Respondents were part of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse's multi-site Cooperative Agreement for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Community-Based Outreach/Intervention Research. At each site, active drug injectors and crack cocaine users were selected by targeted sampling methods. The intervention included pre-HIV test counseling, voluntary HIV testing, a post-testing counseling session focused on risk-reduction strategies, and an optional session for HIV-positive participants. The mean age of respondents was 38.5 years; 82.9% were unemployed. 62.5% had a history of sexually transmitted diseases and 12.5% (9.3% of African Americans and 31.9% of Puerto Ricans) were HIV-positive. At baseline, 63.5% of African Americans and 47.2% of Puerto Ricans were engaging in unprotected vaginal intercourse and 3.1% and 8.3%, respectively, were practicing unprotected anal intercourse. Injection risk factors after counseling were independent of HIV test result among African Americans; among Puerto Ricans, a positive HIV test increased the likelihood of shared use of cookers. In both ethnic groups, seropositives were significantly less likely to persist in practicing unprotected vaginal sex. Seropositive African Americans were also less likely to continue to practice unprotected oral sex. Since heterosexual relations with an HIV-positive drug user is a major risk factor for sex partners and children, this screening and counseling program can have a substantial impact on control of the AIDS epidemic in the US."

        "title": "Florida teenagers learn about AIDS, teach others.",
        "abstract": "1 of every 7 people living in one 5-block area of Belle Glade, Florida, is seropositive for HIV. The town has a population of 17,000 which almost doubles during harvest season as migrant workers arrive to cut cane or harvest vegetables. 97% of HIV cases are among Blacks and people from the Caribbean; transmission is mostly through heterosexual intercourse; and about 25% of infections are among children born to HIV-infected mothers or among adolescents. The nearest movie theater or shopping mall in which adolescents might be amused lies 45 minutes away by buses which do not run on weekends. Belle Glade does not even have a recreation center. Drug use, prostitution, gang membership, and unprotected sexual intercourse are therefore commonly practiced. Providing a constructive alternative, the Health Education Research Team (HEART) peer education project was implemented with the support of the American Foundation for AIDS Research and Family Health International to reduce risky sex behavior among these adolescents aged 13-18. The project assumes that youth will listen to their peers and trains teens to teach other teens about HIV prevention. Teenage participants advance over the levels of trainee, educator, and mentor. 51 had been recruited into the program since it began in fall 1992; 15 had reached the educator level by early 1993. Participants meet twice weekly for formal sessions at the health center which tend to be fun and innovative learning sessions complemented by work in training manuals and periodic tests. Participants also congregate informally at a common youth hangout. More than working to prevent the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, HEART fosters the development of self-esteem, leadership, and communication skills. The program operates a condom distribution system and referral service for treatment which distributed more than 22,000 free condoms over 4 months in late 1992. Understanding their success in being culturally sensitive and reaching out to the community, organizers are considering implementing similar programs in at-risk populations in New York and Texas."

        "abstract": "Although treating and preventing sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) help reduce the spread of HIV, data must be obtained on the types and levels of these STDs, as well as the behavioral factors leading to their spread, before effective prevention interventions may be developed and implemented. To that end, the Department of Epidemiology of the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, the World Health Organization, the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, the Calcutta National Medical College, and the Society for Community Development joined forces to conduct a STD/HIV survey and intervention project for prostitutes and clients in Sonagachi, a red light area in Calcutta. The cluster sample community-based survey of sexual practices and STD/HIV prevalence was the first of its kind in India. The survey revealed STD prevalences up to 50% among the prostitutes, but an HIV prevalence of only slightly more than 1%. These findings suggest an urgent need for general health care services in the area emphasizing the prevention and treatment of STDs. An integrated intervention project financially supported by the Norwegian Agency for Development was therefore developed to prevent the spread of STDs and HIV among prostitutes and their clients. The project provides basic health care services for prostitutes through a public health clinic on premises provided by a local youth club; provides educational programs and activities based on peer education and training, with materials developed for prostitutes and clients; and promotes and provides condoms."

Unprotected sex was a greater risk for transmission even when the researchers adjusted the data to account for injecting drug use, CD4 levels, use of AZT, and sexually transmitted diseases. The reasons for greater transmission remain speculative, but they may be due to the immune system's reaction to sperm, greater inflammation of the cervix from sexual activity, or greater inflammation of the placenta caused by sexual intercourse."

Topics include abortion, family planning (FP), sex education, teenage pregnancy, infertility, maternal and infant care, and sexually transmitted diseases/AIDS. All legislatures convened sessions in 1993 except that of Kentucky, and by the end of February, only Louisiana had not yet convened and no legislature had adjourned. After the US Supreme Court reaffirmed a woman's constitutional right to abortion prior to fetal viability and added that states have broad authority to regulate abortion throughout pregnancy, so long as those regulations do not impose an \"undue burden\" on the right to abortion, 163 abortion-related bills were introduced in 42 states concerning counseling/waiting periods, parental involvement, legality (guarantees and bans), public funding, fetal rights/remains, clinic licensing, reporting requirements, clinic harassment, postviability abortions, sex selection, insurance coverage, comprehensive statutes, RU 486 availability, spousal notification, and conscience clauses. None of the measures has been enacted, although several have advanced or been rejected. Legislative efforts in the areas of FP, sex education, teenage pregnancy, and school-based health clinics, led to the introduction of 118 measures relating to: the availability of FP services, programs, and contraceptives (including Norplant); providing for or limiting the scope of sex education curricula in the public schools; establishing or regulating services offered by school-based health clinics; the prevention of teenage pregnancy and provision of parenting programs; and whether parental consent/notice for contraceptives is needed. No measure has yet been enacted. Infertility matters which were considered included insurance coverage, the legality of surrogate contracts/arrangements, and the licensing of fertility clinics. Maternal and infant health care issues included family/medical leave, services for prenatal care and childbirth, health care through public and private insurance, problems associated with perinatal alcohol and/or drug use, and programs directed at infant care and infant mortality."

Les taux de prévalence de l’année antérieure ont été calculés pour la consommation d’opioïdes, de cocaïne, de crack et de méthamphétamine, et selon la voie d’administration de ces drogues. Une régression logistique bivariée a servi à examiner les liens entre la consommation de drogue et les facteurs sociodémographiques et comportementaux. <b>RÉSULTATS:</b> Plus de 56 % des participants ont déclaré avoir consommé des opioïdes, de la cocaïne, du crack ou de la méthamphétamine au cours de l’année antérieure. Des facteurs de risque d’infections transmissibles sexuellement et par le sang ont souvent été déclarés pour l’année antérieure: 12,2 % s’étaient injecté de la drogue, 78 % avaient eu des rapports sexuels non protégés, et 48 % avaient eu plus d’une ou d’un partenaire sexuel. Selon nos analyses non ajustées, les participants de plus de 24 ans étaient plus susceptibles d’avoir consommé l’une de ces drogues et de s’être injecté de la drogue au cours de l’année antérieure. <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Cette étude présente les premières données canadiennes de la dernière décennie sur la consommation de drogue chez des adultes récemment incarcérés. Nous constatons que la consommation de drogue et les comportements qui augmentent le risque de transmission des infections transmissibles sexuellement et par le sang sont encore très courants dans cette population. L’incarcération présente la possibilité d’offrir des services aux personnes qui consomment de la drogue et de les aiguiller vers des programmes, ce qui pourrait réduire les méfaits liés à la drogue au niveau individuel et sociétal."

Entre juillet 2008 et mai 2009, des adolescents placés dans six CPJ ont rempli un questionnaire au cours d’une entrevue en personne. Les questions portaient sur les comportements sexuels des répondants, leur consommation de substances avant le placement et d’autres enjeux ayant une incidence sur leur santé physique et mentale. Des échantillons d’urine ont été prélevés pour détecter les infections génitales à <i>Chlamydiae trachomatis</i> (IGCT) et les infections génitales à <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> (IGNG). Sur les 578 participants de 14 à 17 ans, 89 % avaient eu des relations sexuelles consensuelles. Les comportements sexuels à risque étaient l’initiation sexuelle précoce (66 % à <14 ans); les partenaires multiples (nombre médian à vie: filles 5, garçons 8); 50 % ou plus de relations sexuelles avec facultés affaiblies par la drogue ou l’alcool (filles 43 %, garçons 48 %); les activités sexuelles en groupe (filles 38 %, garçons 43 %); et les relations sexuelles en échange d’argent ou de cadeaux (filles 27 %, garçons 8 %). Seulement le quart des garçons et des filles avaient utilisé une double protection (condom et méthode anticonceptionnelle) au cours de leur dernière relation vaginale. Des antécédents de grossesse ont été déclarés par 28 % des filles. La prévalence des IGCT était de 9,3 % (IC: 5,5-14,5) chez les filles et de 1,9 % (IC: 0,6-4,4) chez les garçons. La prévalence des IGNG était de 1,7 % (IC: 0,3-4,8) chez les filles et de 0 % (IC: 0,0-1,4) chez les garçons. Dans nos analyses multivariées, les facteurs présentant une corrélation significative avec les infections à chlamydia chez les filles sexuellement actives étaient: l’hospitalisation pour intoxication alcoolique; et des antécédents d’idées suicidaires avec des plans. Les comportements sexuels à risque sont courants chez les adolescents placés dans les CPJ, ce qui entraîne des niveaux élevés d’infections à chlamydia. Des troubles de santé mentale, comme l’abus de substances et les symptômes de dépression grave, sont associés à ces taux élevés. Le séjour d’une ou d’un jeune dans ces centres est un moment opportun de dépister non seulement ses comportements sexuels à risque, mais aussi ses troubles de santé mentale; on peut alors sensibiliser la personne à la réduction des risques et la diriger vers les ressources appropriées."

The youth also participated in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention and sex education activities. Youth from all 4 sites reported early sexual activity and multiple partners. Sex was used in all 4 sites to obtain pleasure (recreation), income (prostitution), food or shelter (survival sex), and power (gang rape). Philippine youth reported prostitution and survival sex, including homosexual sex, with foreigners and locals. Kenyan girls reported both prostitution (their main occupation) and survival sex. Kenyan males reported prostitution with foreigners and locals, and rapes of girls. In Bogota, males reported rapes of girls, and gang rapes of females for punishment or initiation. They also reported using sex workers and exchanging sex with men or women for food and shelter. Females from Bogota reported that their \"friends\" sometimes used survival sex to support their children; nearly all had been previously involved in survival sex on the street. Sexual abuse was common in Kenya and the Philippines; some youth in Manila were abused at shelters. In all 4 sites, there was a high awareness of AIDS and STDs, but information was often incorrect, especially in regard to transmission and treatment of STDs. Although nearly all of the youth knew about modes of transmission of HIV, those from the Philippines and Colombia did not have a personal realization or fear that they could contract it, while those from Kenya and Thailand believed they were at high risk and wanted assistance. 20/21 Kenyan girls were tested by the Undugu Society for HIV after detection of current STD infections in 7 of them; 4 were HIV positive. 2 of these have returned home, and 2 are being provided shelter, counseling and support by the Society. Without changing the problems that create a need for survival sex among youth, little can be done about promoting safe sex and healthy lifestyles."

        "abstract": "Focus group discussions and interviews with 240 single adolescent women who had migrated to northern Thailand to work in the garment industry revealed a high incidence of unprotected premarital sex and widespread misinformation about the risk of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Many believed that \"good people\" could not get AIDS and that condoms were men's concern, for use with prostitutes rather than girlfriends. In response, an educational program was designed for these young factory workers with the aim of providing accurate information and encouraging women to insist on protected sex. Peer education was selected as the strategy most likely to promote participatory learning, skill acquisition, and emotional support. Educational materials were interactive and based on problem-solving. A comic book featured an invisible flying condom that instructed young women how to negotiate condom use; a romantic novel about a young migrant factory worker addressed the false notion that \"good men\" cannot become infected with AIDS. The peer education program lasted for 3 months, after which participants received a certificate. Post-program evaluation indicated widespread acceptance of condoms as a contraceptive option for women and enhanced relational skills in negotiating for safe sex."

        "abstract": "Adolescent pregnancy increases the risk of pregnancy complications, low birth weight (LBW), and infant mortality. Complications include urinary tract infections, acute pyelonephritis, and preeclampsia. Full eclampsia is often fatal, thus preeclamptic women are delivered immediately. LBW (below 2500 g) is caused by prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation, both of which factors are associated with adolescence. In 1989, approximately 7% of all live births in the US were LBW (5.7% White and 13.5% Black). A large sample of births in 1975-78 found increased risk of neonatal mortality for the infants of adolescents, possibly owing to higher rates of LBW. In 1991, a random sample of 389 adolescent mothers who had given birth in 1983 indicated a 54% rate of depression, and even higher rates existed among those with 2 or more pregnancies. Additional risk factors include socioeconomic circumstances (poor housing, nutrition, and cultural deprivation). In a 1991 study of adolescent mothers, 80% of Blacks and 57% of Whites lived in female-headed households. Of the total, 1% of Blacks and 25% of Whites were married and living together. 45% of Whites and 58% of Blacks lived in poverty. Only 44% of these women used prenatal care in the 1st trimester, and 11% had no regular source of health care at 15-18 months after childbirth. A 1989 study of 253 pregnant women aged 19 or younger showed that 52.2% admitted drinking alcohol, 31.6% admitted using marijuana, and 13.8% admitted using cocaine during pregnancy. Nutritional problems included skipping meals and eating junk food, as well as not getting enough food, although they were entitled to government food stamps. Immaturity and lack of knowledge also contributed to poor health. Prenatal clinics, school-based clinics, and hospitals have to encourage prenatal care (e.g., the Johns Hopkins University comprehensive maternity-care program for adolescents), treat depression, assess their concrete needs regarding services and eligibility, and recognize that adolescents have cognitive and emotional limitations."

They are therefore subjected to poor health, malnutrition, endemic sexually transmitted diseases, and a myriad of social problems including prostitution, displacement, resettlement, and substance abuse. Lack of condom availability and use and the plethora of languages in which interventions must be communicated also pose obstacles. 860 languages are spoken by the 3 million first peoples in Papua New Guinea. As HIV sweeps across continents and through populations worldwide, these aforementioned conditions certainly predispose indigenous peoples to the risk of contracting and spreading HIV. The lack of reliable reporting systems to monitor health conditions and the incidence and prevalence of HIV among indigenous populations, and the corresponding lack of hard data make it impossible to reliably estimate the extent of HIV therein. Factors which increase the likelihood that HIV and AIDS will reach epidemic proportions among the indigenous are specially described for Amazonia, Guatemala, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, India, Africa, Australia, Canada, and the US."

The menstrual flow was decreased in 62% and increased in 4%. Duration of the menstrual cycle was decreased in 57% and unchanged in 41%. 34% indicated less dysmenorrhea while taking OCs. There were some differences between married and single women when questioned about their sexual drive. 68% of the married women and 71% of the single were without change in their libido. 21% of the married women felt that their libido diminished. 22% of single women experienced increased libido. 31% of the single women had a heightened sexual response while only 17% of the married women reported this. Sexual activity increased in 40% of the single women and 16% of the married women. Libido decreased as family size increased. There were only minor differences in changes among those who use different OCs. There was a progressive decrease in libido, sexual response, and sexual activity during the first 2-3 years of medication. After 5 years, however, sexual response was progressively heightened. Fear of pregnancy was uniformly lessened with OCs in 72-75% of all patients. Individuals may have changes in their sexual drives secondary to OCs.

Adolescents face more risks during pregnancy: toxemia, anomalies of the pelvic region, difficulties in vaginal delivery and surgery (episiotomy, cesarean section, and hysterectomy) are more frequent among them than among older women. In the capital low birth weight babies (most of them born prematurely) account for 11.6-12.5% of all deliveries; this figure rises to 17.2% for women under 20 and to 20% for females under 18. Perinatal mortality of infants born to adolescents is 13.8%. At a university hospital in the capital 114 of 128 of married women and 90 of 113 single females had children.

For most notifiable STDs, the highest rates of incidence are found in 20-24 years olds, followed by people aged 25-29 and 15-19. Among sexually active teenagers, the highest incidence of STD infection is among the youngest teens. For most STDs, the overall morbidity rate is higher for men than for women. STD control programs need to be designed and implemented with the understanding that migration has always been linked with STD. Sexual preference, marital status, socioeconomic status, place of residence, prostitution, migration, principal STDs, populations at risk, and prevention and control measures are discussed. Strategies to prevent STD transmission must remain flexible in order to adapt to prevailing conditions, with adequate clinical services being central in controlling STDs."

El efecto de la violencia sexual sufrida durante el servicio militar, o el trauma sexual militar, en la satisfacción con la relación amorosa entre miembros o veteranos masculinos del servicio militar se ha estudiado muy poco. Sin embargo, en un estudio reciente realizado en mujeres se observó que el trauma sexual militar que implicó abuso estuvo asociado con una peor satisfacción con la relación mediante una mayor disfunción sexual y una menor satisfacción sexual. El presente estudio amplió la bibliografía analizando la función sexual como mediadora de la asociación de la exposición al trauma sexual militar y la satisfacción con la relación amorosa entre miembros o veteranos masculinos del servicio militar que están en pareja (N=499). Los participantes completaron medidas de autoinforme sobre la exposición al trauma sexual militar, la satisfacción con la relación amorosa, la disfunción eréctil y el comportamiento sexual compulsivo, así como un inventario demográfico. El puntaje promedio de la satisfacción con la relación estuvo en el rango de riesgo. Sesenta y cuatro participantes (el 12.83 %) informaron exposición al trauma sexual militar. La exposición al trauma sexual militar estuvo relacionada con una menor satisfacción con la relación mediante un mayor comportamiento sexual compulsivo. El modelo explicó el 16 % de la varianza en la satisfacción con la relación. El efecto indirecto de la disfunción eréctil no fue significativo. Los resultados actuales coinciden con la investigación sobre las mujeres integrantes o veteranas del servicio militar: la asociación del trauma sexual militar y la satisfacción con la relación amorosa parece ser indirecta, mediante los efectos de la función sexual. La terapia de pareja puede ser más eficaz si aborda las preocupaciones sobre la salud sexual entre los hombres sobrevivientes al trauma sexual militar, particularmente la práctica de comportamientos sexuales compulsivos. Debido a un bajo informe de trauma sexual militar que haya implicado abuso, no se pudo analizar el efecto de la intensidad del trauma sexual militar."

        "title": "Adolescent sexuality.",
        "abstract": "In this discussion of adolescent sexuality, focus is on biological, behavioral, and developmental aspects as well as the problematic aspects. The marked hormonal changes that occur in puberty somehow influence the sexual motivation of the adolescent. Such influence operates in a psychosocial context, which in tern determines in crucial ways how the adolescent behaves sexually. Much of what is commonly understood as constituting sexual behavior does not result in orgasm, but orgasm is a convenient measure of sexual activity that can be quantified. Existing statistics regarding sexual behavior in adolescents are generally of questionable reliability, but a few are cited in an effort to provide a general idea of the ranges involved. There is good evidence that the rate of premarital sex among women has increased considerably during the past 10-year period. For members of both sexes, the 1st coitus tends to take place with someone they have known for quite some time, although males tend to be more opportunistic in this regard. Coitus is usually a milestone in the continuum of psychosexual development. Adolescent sexuality needs to be examined in the larger general context of adolescence as a phase of life and more specifically in terms of the particular experience of that phase for a given individual. The relationship of sexuality to 3 key developmental tasks is considered: the formation of personal identity, the maturation of interpersonal relationships, and the enhancement of self-esteem. The 2 most common medical concerns arising from adolescent sexual behavior are pregnancy and venereal disease."

La prevalencia del VIH fue del 15,4 % (95 % intervalo de confianza de 95 %: 11,4 a 19,4 %, n = 318 testados). Entre los camioneros VIH-positivo, el 83,7 % no sabía su seroestado. Un tercio de los CLD nunca había hecho la prueba del VIH y tres en cuatro CLD no recibieron gratuitamente condones, lubricantes o literatura del VIH en los últimos 12 meses. En lo mismo período, el 61,4 % de los CLD tuvo al menos cuatro parejas sexuales y el 27,1 % pagó por sexo. Entre los CLD sexualmente activos, 76,5 % no utilizó un preservativo en su última relación sexual. El VIH se asoció significativamente (p < 0,05) con educación primaria o inferior (razón de probabilidad ajustada-AOR: 2.1), residencia en Mozambique (AOR 2.3) y nunca haber hecho la prueba del VIH (AOR 2.2).

        "abstract": "Social and economic factors determine the extent of the sex industry in societies. Despite AIDS, the sex industry will continue to thrive. Accordingly, health promotion strategies aimed at sex workers and their clients should not stem from the belief that the industry should cease to exist. This paper offers advice in developing and implementing programs to promote safer sex among sex workers. The social context is 1 element to consider in planning successful campaigns. Interventions must be combined with well-planned prevention campaigns aimed at entire populations. The opinions and participation of those involved in the industry should also be sought, while worker discussion and action upon other community issues should not be discouraged. Care should be given to target the numerous and diverse sex worker audiences in addition to other persons related to and involved in the industry. Programs should address the main obstacles to practicing safer sex, and attention should be given to ensure the provision of an adequate and regular supply of cheap or free condoms through varied distribution channels. In the area of service provision, sex workers need easy access to social support and health care services from which they are often excluded. Activities conducted around the world include the marketing of safer sex, distributing printed information on HIV and AIDS to clients, training sex workers to pass designated constructive ideas to others involved in the sex industry, referring sex workers to sex businesses supportive of safer sex practices, and developing street theater and cabaret shows in bars."

        "abstract": "HIV-related knowledge, attitudes, and risk behaviors were investigated in a study of 58 primarily Latina, low-income adolescent mothers (mean age, 17.5 years) enrolled in the Rhode Island (US) Hospital Teen-Tot Clinic. Respondents expressed fear concerning the threat of AIDS and 9% were worried they had already been exposed to HIV. Their basic knowledge about HIV transmission was adequate. Despite substantial anxiety about HIV infection, 47.4% of teen mothers did not use condoms consistently, 31.7% had 2 or more sex partners in the past year, 14.0% had a history of a sexually transmitted disease, and 22.8% had intentionally cut their body with an instrument such as a razor blade or pen. Although 70% used hormonal contraception, 33% of respondents had a second child within an average of 18 months of the birth of the first. Consistent condom users were significantly more likely than those who almost never or never used condoms to report personalized anxiety and concern about HIV/AIDS, significantly less likely to engage in self-mutilating behaviors, and significantly more likely to express intentions to engage in future HIV prevention behaviors. In focus groups discussions attended by 59 respondents, teen mothers expressed a sense of powerlessness in negotiating condom use with older male sexual partners and cultural taboos against condom use in primary relationships. Latinas viewed assertive sexual decision-making as incompatible with cultural norms regarding the female role. While hormonal methods of contraception were perceived as a medical regimen, barrier methods were associated with a culturally unacceptable premeditated decision to have sex."

        "abstract": "The HIV epidemic is far from over in Thailand. A male population with high levels of HIV sexual risk behavior and, in particular, the widespread and frequent use of commercial sex helps to perpetuate the epidemic. Condom use has risen dramatically in commercial sex, but much more remains to be accomplished before HIV is brought under control in Thailand. For example, the Thai population is quite knowledgeable about HIV and AIDS. Efforts must be made, however, to clear up major misconceptions harbored by many people about the disease. Sexually active men must be made aware that they cannot tell by looking at a person whether he or she is infected with HIV. Little is known about risk behaviors or seroprevalence in homosexual and bisexual men. Increasingly, noncommercial casual sexual contacts will assume a much larger role in HIV transmission in Thailand. Available evidence suggests that women are engaging in premarital and extramarital sex often enough to justify intensifying intervention programs targeting these women. The development and implementation of these latter interventions are particularly critical given the high levels of HIV infection among young Thai men and the low levels of condom use in these noncommercial sexual encounters. Blood transfusion is no longer an important route of HIV transmission, although the use of unsterile injection equipment by medical practitioners outside of the formal medical system may still be an issue of concern."

        "title": "Adolescent sexuality and public policy.",
        "abstract": "This analysis of national surveys of teenage sexual behavior in the US provides a more useful and precise estimate of teenage sexual activity for policy and program decisions. Data were taken from the 1979 National Survey of Men (NSYM), and Women (NSYW), and the 1982 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). Analysis was based on 1) the % of unmarried respondents who were sexually experienced and the % who were sexually active, and 2) the % sexually experienced who were sexually active. The distinction between sexual activity vs. experience shows considerable differences; i.e., for women 15-19 in 1979, 46% were sexually experienced but only 26% were sexually active at the time of the survey. Further delineation is made for never, seldom, monthly, and currently active by race. Black women 15-19 in 1982 were shown to be no more sexually active than white women. However, from the NSYM black males followed the traditional pattern of higher sexual activity, with 68.2% for blacks vs. 60.1% for whites. The data dispute the typical image of rampant sexual portrayed by the popular press. The public policy response to this epidemic was to adopt a family planning (FP) approach to teenage pregnancy prevention. Reduced adolescent pregnancy rates as a measure of program effectiveness have not been shown, and program effectiveness must be based on other measures. Sex education also has had limited success in reducing adolescent pregnancy. The suggestion is that access to accurate information, student liking, parental support, and knowledge acquisition are more reasonable criteria for demonstrating success of sex education programs. Abstinence programs help reduce the risks of teenage pregnancy by emphasizing skills in decision making and resisting pressures to be sexually involved. The example is given of an Atlanta-based program, Postponing Sexual Involvement, which reported that 84% resisted becoming sexually involved after completion of the program. Other abstinence programs show promise and are an inexpensive alternative to FP, albeit evaluations are needed. Contraceptive approaches are appropriate for the already sexually active population."

Since approximately 10 years are needed for an initial HIV infection to develop into AIDS it is logical to assume that young adults of less than 29 years with AIDS were infected during adolescence. The Executive Director of PROFAMILIA notes also the significant public health problems tied to the increase in unwanted adolescent pregnancies, the beginning of sexual activity in people younger than 12 years old, and the increase in AIDS cases among people younger than 29 years old. In response, the organization mounted a program of preventive education enabling youths and adults to use peer counseling techniques to teach young people about responsible sexual practices, sexually transmitted diseases (STD), and the prevention of HIV/AIDS. The AIDS Project for Adolescents is a new initiative in which young people, through peer education, learn about STDs and HIV/AIDS prevention. The design is innovative due to its departure from a model in which the adult provides sex education from an authoritative point of view. PROFAMILIA has also formed 8 Family Planning Information Centers strategically located around the island to increase residents' accessibility to family planning. These successful and well-accepted centers offer a range of medical and laboratory services, as well as affordably priced contraceptives."

In Africa, AIDS shows a pattern of heterosexual transmission, and prevalence rates are highest among younger, sexually active women who have sexual relations with older men. 61% of African women with AIDS compared with 36% of male victims are unmarried. Prostitutes have consistently shown the highest rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection--27-88% in various studies. In most areas of Africa, female prostitutes and men and women with a history of multiple sex partners in the previous 5 years contribute the majority of AIDS cases. 35% of AIDS patients also report having had at least 1 sexually transmitted disease in the 3 years preceding diagnosis. The high correlation between HIV seropositivity and genital ulcers suggests that the disruption of genital epithelial integrity may promote the transmission of HIV infection during vaginal intercourse. 2 additional factors--blood transfusions and exposure to blood- contaminated needles and syringes--are amplifying the dissemination of AIDS into the general population of Africa. Encouraging are findings among prostitutes that HIV transmission can be eliminated by consistent condom use and significantly reduced even when condoms are used in only half of sexual encounters. Africa presents numerous cultural, social, and economic obstacles to the effective prevention and control of AIDS. Integration of programs aimed at reducing risk factors into existing health and educational projects is necessary, as is the full support of government agencies."

        "abstract": "For some couples sexual intercourse during menses is both acceptable and pleasurable, while for others it is an undesirable or unacceptable sexual pattern. When counseling couples about having sexual intercourse during menses, one need to keep in mind both the advantages and possible disadvantages. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is the most threatening risk of having coitus during menses. A woman who has experienced PID or a woman at high risk of developing PID may want her partner to use a condom if she wants to have intercourse during menses. Religious reasons may keep couples from sexual intercourse during menses. Women with very short monthly cycles may, from time to time, ovulate during menses. The use of tampons during menses may make the vagina very dry, and extra lubrication may be required. If sexual intercourse during menses does not lead to orgasm for the woman, pelvic congestion may be increased, thereby increasing the dysmenorrhea a woman experiences. The advantages of intercourse during menses are: pregnancy is far less likely to occur; by diminishing pelvic congestion, orgasm may significantly decrease the amount of dysmenorrhea a woman experiences; blood may be a good lubricant; and there are less days of abstinence in the monthly cycle."

        "abstract": "Adolescent risk behavior is determined, in large part, by the perceived or actual social behavior of one's close friends. Thus, an intervention delivered to youth along with his or her friends could be a powerful vehicle for proactive behavior change. This possibility was assessed in 382 low-income African-American adolescent friends 9-15 years of age who were recruited from public housing developments for a longitudinal HIV risk-reduction program. These young people formed 76 friendship groups. The intervention, based on protection motivation theory, was delivered through weekly meetings of 38 of the friendship groups; the remaining 38 groups met weekly, but there were no social-cognitive interventions. Both groups received general education on HIV/AIDS and free condoms. In the intervention group, the percentage of groups in which all sexually active members used condoms increased from 33% at baseline to 69% after 6 months, 50% at 12 months (an expectable decline, indicating the need for a \"booster\" intervention), and 72% at 18 months. Among control friendship groups, however, homogeneous condom use within a group remained relatively stable: 17% at baseline, 18% at 6 months, 38% at 12 months, and 29% at 18 months. The intervention's impact was strongest among groups of youth with a low baseline prevalence of risk behaviors. These findings confirm the potential of use of group process as a vehicle for behavior change among adolescents."

In contemporary Indonesian societies, sex is often infused with negative connotations and referred to as taboo. Considering the threat that an AIDS pandemic poses, HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment represent a critical development issue that requires ongoing commitment from the Indonesian Government and the international donors that provide critical financial support in the health sector. These taboos that inhibit communication about sexuality clearly constrain attempts to challenge negative understandings of sexuality as inherently shameful. However, promotion of reproductive/sexual health and HIV/AIDS prevention is highly contingent upon expanded dialogue about sexuality in both private and public domains. Hence, the author emphasized the need to acknowledge the complex ways in which sexual communication is circumscribed by enduring cultural taboos, and also how sexual dialogue operates to subvert and erode those taboos."

        "abstract": "Among adolescents, rates of premarital intercourse have increased, age at first intercourse has decreased, and couples are delaying marriage to a greater extent since the 1970s. These factors effectively combine to increase the risk of female adolescents becoming pregnant and/or infected with sexually transmitted diseases (STD). As might be expected, birth and STD rates have also increased dramatically over the past two decades, confirming that youths continue to engage in unprotected sexual activity. Pregnant adolescents deserve particular attention from prevention interventions, for they show tangible evidence of a history of unprotected sexual activity. This study specifically considers risky sex behavior within a target group of 241 urban, unmarried pregnant adolescents aged 17 and younger and the behavioral relationship with substance use. Compared to women from a national sample of high school seniors, these pregnant women had higher or comparable lifetime use rates for all substances. 94% had used alcohol, 78% marijuana, 30% cocaine, and 30% stimulants compared to 92%, 48% 14%, and 23%, respectively, among women in the national sample. 84% of pregnant adolescents had had more than one sexual partner, 39% had had an STD, and 60% had used contraception in less than half their sexual encounters. Further, 70% ran away from home before pregnancy, 62% were suspended or expelled from school, and 24% served time in jail/detention. Cigarettes and alcohol in general, and alcohol and drug use during sex, were positively associated with risky sexual behavior. The effect of substance use, however, disappeared when controlling through multivariate analysis for family bonding, parental monitoring, commitment to conventional values, peer associations, self-esteem, and delinquent activities. These results suggest that both substance use and increased risk of pregnancy in the study sample may be associated with a syndrome of problem behaviors and life circumstances. While more research is needed, it appears that the messages \"just say no\" and \"always use condoms\" will be inadequate to bring about positive change."

        "abstract": "Interviews with heterosexual men and women recruited at discos and bars in Melbourne, Australia, in 1993 revealed a tendency--especially among women--to construct sex as \"safe\" within the discourses of \"love\" and \"romance.\" The 112 respondents (mean age, 27.4 years) were asked to narrate their experiences of sex, love, romance, and safety, with particular emphasis on casual sexual encounters. Casual sex was viewed as an essential strategy in the search for love, and sexual safety practices were related more to their anticipated impact on finding love than on an assessment of the potential of sexually transmitted disease transmission. This view is consistent with cultural notions of femininity in sex as the relinquishment of control for the sake of love. Both men and women commented on the difficulties of raising the issue of condom use and HIV/AIDS prevention with someone they had just met. This difficulty was even more pronounced among women, who tended to believe insistence on condom use would result in the loss of a sexual encounter with romantic potential. Many men reported they use this perception of potential rejection to convince women to engage in unprotected sex. These findings suggest that current HIV/AIDS prevention messages may be disregarded by individuals--especially unmarried women--who view condom use as an obstacle in their quest for love. Needed are messages that incorporate condom use into the search for love."

Included in the survey were 862 male and female students from the Obafemi Awolowo University in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, and 587 students from the University of Zimbabwe in Harare; the age range was 17-21 years. Overall, students were well informed about AIDS, with no significant differences by country or gender. The most commonly cited source of information was television. Despite adequate knowledge levels, there was a significant incidence of high-risk sexual behaviors. Of the students who had practiced oral or anal sex in the two months preceding the survey, only 24.8% had always used condoms and 29.4% had never used condoms. In general, condom use was not perceived as necessary in sexual encounters involving a regular partner. Condom users were significantly more likely than non-users to have received safe sex counseling, perceive peers as supportive of risk-reduction behaviors, possess an accurate assessment of their personal risk, and have access to free condoms. In addition, female students were more likely than their male counterparts to ask partners about their sexual history, intravenous drug use, and blood transfusions. Urged is the elaboration of AIDS prevention models derived from psychological research pertaining to factors that influence risk behavior decision making processes."

        "abstract": "A review of the literature indicates that women with schizophrenia may have limited knowledge about sexuality, high rates of coerced sex, low contraceptive usage, many unwanted pregnancies, and severe parenting difficulties. Given problems with contraceptive compliance, long-acting hormonal methods are optimal. Since schizophrenic women are especially vulnerable to exacerbations of mental illness during pregnancy, the risks to the mother of withholding pharmacotherapy must be weighed against the slight increase in risks of congenital anomalies associated with such treatment. Postpartum psychotic episodes are also common, with serious consequences for the mother-infant relationship. The quality of child care provided by mothers with schizophrenia may be compromised by a reduced ability to read children's cues and weak social support networks. Mental health services and child welfare agencies need to collaborate to weigh the risks to a child of remaining with a psychotic parent versus those of being removed from the home. Recommended for mental heath practice are the following: incorporation of sex education and assertiveness training into psychosocial rehabilitation programs, HIV education and screening, systems for the early detection of pregnancy in chronically mentally ill women, steps to reduce the likelihood of relapse during the vulnerable postpartum period, improved methods for assessing parenting capability, parenting education, and the incorporation of family planning programs into mental health care delivery systems."

        "title": "AIDS epidemic in Malawi: shaking cultural foundations.",
        "abstract": "Many young men and women in Malawi are infected with HIV and dying from AIDS. The head of the Malawi AIDS Control Program estimates that as many as 10% of all adults in the country may be infected with HIV, with the rate being higher in urban areas. While more than 90% of the population is now aware of the existence of AIDS and its dangers, changes in behavior have not taken place and HIV continues to spread. Early campaigns attempted to generate condom use through peer educators among bar girls, truck drivers, and STD patients. Many men state, however, that they prefer to have sex without condoms because it is more exciting. Others cite alcohol consumption, ignorance of the dangers of HIV infection, and/or a fear of suggesting mistrust in a partner as reasons for not using condoms. Many women also find it difficult to negotiate condom use among reluctant men. Making condoms readily accessible and giving them a positive image may help increase their rate of use; the opposition of some religious groups must be thwarted and the distribution system needs to be improved to realize these ends. Condoms are provided to Malawi free of charge by the US Agency of International Development. Supplies are then either distributed free through health centers and bars or sold in shops. The failure of free condoms to be readily available in rural areas where 90% of the population resides, however, poses concern. Finally, training programs, counseling, anonymous HIV testing centers, and peer educators are among some of the interventions being made against AIDS in Malawi."

        "abstract": "Patterns of contraceptive use should change as women advance through the stages of reproductive life. Natural family planning, barrier methods, IUDs, combined oral contraceptives, progestogen-only contraception, and sterilization represent feasible contraceptive choices for women 40 years of age and older. The current recommendation is that a non-hormonal contraceptive method be continued until a woman has experienced 1 year of amenorrhea if she is aged 50 years or older and 2 years of amenorrhea if she is younger than 50 years. Women who start hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms or prevention of osteoporosis before menopause should discontinue this treatment for six weeks so follicle stimulating hormone levels (indicative of menopausal status) can be checked; alternatively, they can continue contraception until age 55 years. Healthy women with no risk factors can take combined oral contraceptives up to age 50 years for pregnancy prevention, cycle control, and relief of early menopausal symptoms. In the future, contraceptives may be designed that combine fertility control with positive reproductive health benefits such as protection against ovarian cancer."

The sample included about 20,300 reproductive-age women. One in three women reported a health problem of some kind during the course of pregnancy. One in 16 reported a very severe problem. 1 in 340 died as a result of the pregnancy. 33% of severe complications were due to obstructed labor. 21% were due to hemorrhage before or during delivery. Eclampsia and hypertensive complications were the cause of 10% of severe complications. Only 1.5% of complications were due to infections, but these infections were the cause of most maternal mortality. One woman in five reported a current unwanted pregnancy. 80% of pregnant women delivered in a health facility. 83% were full-term pregnancies. 22% of births weighed under 2500 g (low birth weight). Most women had at least two prenatal visits by the 8th month of pregnancy, but consultations were not successful in identifying complications. Researchers recommend improved training of health providers, strengthened care during the 3rd trimester, and training of motivated persons to assist at the birth."

Neste sentido, esta pesquisa objetiva identificar as demandas de autistas sobre sua sexualidade, alinhando-se ao paradigma da neurodiversidade. Trata-se de uma pesquisa de natureza qualitativa realizada de setembro de 2017 a outubro de 2018, com 14 autistas oralizados, com idades de 15 a 17 anos, matriculados em escolas regulares. A coleta dos dados foi realizada por entrevistas semiestruturadas e avaliadas segundo a análise temática de conteúdo. Identificaram-se 2 categorias analíticas: “processos discursivos e a imagética do ‘anjo azul’” e “diversidade na diversidade: a sexualidade de autistas como processos singulares”. Os resultados que embora pessoas autistas se desenvolvam fisicamente e sexualmente de acordo com os estágios típicos de desenvolvimento, existem singularidades que não deveriam ser ignoradas. Todavia, a construção de falsas crenças fomenta a negação da sexualidade de pessoas autistas. Conclui-se que o estabelecimento de ações efetivas de educação sexual e de suporte à sexualidade da pessoa autista requer uma mudança paradigmática, que ancore-se no modelo social de deficiência."

Moreover, a person may have a certain sexual behavior with his or her primary sex partner which differs from that shared with other secondary partners. Sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention and control programs may therefore need to address individuals' differential risk with each partner type. Relationship characteristics, partner risk behaviors, and sex behaviors were studied among 123 male and 106 female STD clinic patients who had both main and other partners. Among men and women with both main and other frequent partners, 48% of men and 41% of women had known their main partner, but not their other partners, for at least 1 year. These proportions compare to 2% of men and 9% of women who had known their other frequent partners, but not their main partner, for at least 1 year. Among those with main and casual partners, both men and women were more likely to use alcohol or drugs before or during sex with main partners only (15%) than with casual partners only (1-3%). Women with main and casual partners were more likely to have oral sex only with main partners than only with casual partners (37% vs. 3%), and were more likely to use condoms only with casual partners than only with main partners (33% vs. 4%)."

The project specifically promoted condom use and was conducted within the context of BEMFAM's Integrated Family Planning Program. Villa Mimoza, a prostitution zone in the Estacio neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, was the site of the intervention. This neighborhood harbors 44 houses of prostitution where an estimated 500 female prostitutes receive clients. An agreement was reached with the Association of Prostitutes of the State of Rio de Janeiro whereby it would help mobilize local women, merchants, brothel owners, and clients. Initial needs were assessed by BEMFAM and AIDSCOM through questionnaires and focus groups. It was subsequently resolved that radio programs, counter displays of educational materials in brothels, and posters in brothel rooms would be the most effective channels through which to carry integrated, effective messages to the community. Final evaluation found a change in attitude and an awareness of the importance of measures to prevent AIDS along with a prevalent increase in condom use."

        "abstract": "In certain animals the effects of gonadal steroids on sexual behavior are mediated directly by the central nervous system: however, in humans the degree to which sexual identity or sexual role behavior is directly determined by endocrine function is unclear. Furthermore, the relative importance of hormonal versus psychiatric, social, and cultural factors as determinents of sexual identify is in dispute. The findings of Imperato-McGinley and her associates, published in this issue, tend to support the theory that hormonal factors are of primary importance in determining male sexual identity. Patients with a deficiency of steroid 5alpha-reductase have decreased digydrotestosterone production during fetal development, and are thus born with female-like external genital organs. Generally they are raised as females but during childhood and puberty normal testerone activity takes place; therefore, at puberty the majority of these individuals assume a male identity. This identity change was attributed to androgen activity. Studies of this nature contribute to our understanding of the role of hormones; however, it must be kept in mind that the study provides only circumstantial evidence and that the findings do not rule out the possible influence of psychological, social, or cultural factors on sexual role behavior. For example, male pseudohermaphradites are frequently born with clitoromegaly, and during childhood this may introduce feelings of uncertainty as to sexual identity. Nor is it clear that the change to male identity is the result of the direct effect of testosterone on the central nervous system; the enlargement of accessory male organs at puberty may itself influence sexual role behavior."

        "abstract": "The effects of mother and daughter reproductive changes on maternal perceptions regarding the family are assessed. Mother and daughter reproductive status changes were examined in terms of their effects on family relations and mother and daughter well-being. Controls were made for mother and daughter age and heaviness. 144 mothers (37-59 years) and daughters (14-18 years) were selected from a study of white, middle to upper middle income families in large Eastern metropolitan areas. Mothers were typically well educated and employed and from 2-parent homes; 50% were 1st born. Moos' Family Environment Scale was used to measure family functioning; other measures included daughter's age at menarche, mother's menstrual status, the Ponderal index of mother and daughter heaviness, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale, an abbreviated version of the Eating Attitudes Test, and Satisfaction with Body Parts scale of Padin, Lerner and Spiro. Self-administered questionnaires were mailed after agreement to participate was confirmed by phone. Analysis of covariance was used to analyze the effect of menstrual status controlling for age on family cohesion or conflict, and the effect of perception of family cohesion or conflict on well-being. Factor-covariate interactions were tested for, and none were found based on the Bonferroni procedure. The cross-sectional results show that early adolescent maturation is not related to increases in family conflict compared with on-time or late maturers, in contrast to Hill's study results. There was no link between perceptions of family conflict on the well-being of mother or daughter. Family cohesion was important to mother and daughter well-being, but was not associated with mother's reproductive status or daughter's reproductive timing. For mothers, the effect was on depression and body image. For daughters, the most important variable was maternal perceptions of family cohesion for all measures of well-being. Daughters' perceptions of well-being were not associated with any well-being measures. Mother's menstrual status and interaction with daughter's menarcheal timing were related to maternal dieting behavior and bulimic symptoms. For daughters, mother's reproductive status and daughter's reproductive timing was significantly related to dieting behavior. Maternal age was related to maternal well-being (depression)."

        "abstract": "The purpose was to demonstrate that the notion that HIV is transmitted with little impediment during vaginal intercourse by healthy adults was likely to be confounded because of various forms of unreliability including deception on the part of the respondents in epidemiological and clinical studies. The topics examined covered risk groups and behaviors, respondent reports, animal models, and lying and other sources of unreliability. The safety of condoms and spermicides was also compared in regard to protection against HIV. Regarding risk groups and behaviors, anal intercourse and unsterile iv activity were found to be potent vectors for HIV transmission and appeared to be the behaviors associated with primary risk group membership. The frequency of heterosexual anal intercourse was 18.6% among North American college women according to a 1990 study, providing a potent vector for HIV transmission. Patient reports indicated that even to inquire about activities known to spread HIV (iv activity and anal intercourse) had resulted in incorrect attribution of such spread to vaginal intercourse. Animal models could not be taken as a model for HIV transmission. 1993 Centers for Disease Control tabulations based on 94% of all AIDS cases recorded in the US through September 1993 indicated that 1.0% of male AIDS patients (2899 of 281,168) and 10.1% of female AIDS patients (3773 of 37,314) denied being in such groups. Another 1.3% (3715 of 281,168) of male AIDS patients attributed their AIDS to heterosexual contact with iv drug users, transfusees, or sub-Saharan Africans. The total liar rate was 5% among AIDS patients. Lying by respondents, their inability to recollect the details of sexual activity, and the intellectual limitations of some respondents resulted in seropositive subjects failing to report anal intercourse or iv activity. Such failure often resulted in attributing HIV spread to vaginal intercourse."

Topics covered include abortion, family planning, sex and health education, teenage pregnancy, infertility, maternal and infant care, sexually transmitted diseases, and AIDS. Legislatures in every state but Kentucky convened sessions in 1993. By the end of May, 29 legislatures had adjourned. Abortion legislation included: the status of legal abortion, counseling and/or waiting periods, parental involvement, public funding for low income women, harassment of providers. Family planning, sex and health education, and teenage pregnancy legislation covered: family planning, Norplant implants, and teenage pregnancy prevention. Legislation on maternal and infant health care included prenatal care and medicaid, perinatal drug and alcohol abuse (with proposals to make available or expand treatment and rehabilitative services to mount public education campaigns on the effects of alcohol and drug use while pregnant, and to punish women for drug use during pregnancy), and maternity and family medical leave. Infertility legislation covered medical insurance, the legality and regulation of surrogate contracts, other kinds of assisted reproductive technology arrangements, and the licensing of fertility clinics. Under the subject of sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS, legislation included education and prevention strategies, setting guidelines and requirements for testing and reporting, criminal penalties, treatment services and insurance, health care providers and patients, discrimination, and the establishment of study commissions."

        "abstract": "When a member of the Community Life Project in Nigeria led a group of women in a discussion about HIV/AIDS, the women reported that they understood that condom use is the best means of protection but that they were unable to negotiate condom use with their husbands. Even if the women were economically independent, they would rather face the risk of HIV/AIDS than divorce. Thus, efforts to improve women's health have not generated much change on the local level. This can also be seen by the facts that current programs have failed to reduce the numbers of women dying from pregnancy-related causes each year, nearly 3000 women die from tuberculosis each day, women suffer occupational health risks, and domestic violence is an important determinant of health problems for women. Because women lack power in many societies, efforts to effect individual change may be blocked by a woman's particular circumstances. Thus, the involvement of entire communities is necessary to improve the conditions affecting women's health. Community-level discussions may open the door for couples to discuss sexuality and gender-based issues as well as safer sex behavior. Despite the important role they can play, women's community health groups face stiff challenges because of a lack of knowledge or training and because of the difficulty in overcoming gender-based discrimination. The Hesperian Foundation's publication, \"Where Women Have No Doctor,\" is an excellent resource for understanding how poverty and gender issues affect women's health. The book contains practical information, promotes a model of community-based responses to problems with social origins, and shares experiences of grassroots groups world-wide."

The Truck Driver's AIDS Intervention Project (TDAIP) in collaboration with the African Medical Research Foundation (AMREF) and Tanzania's National AIDS Control Program (NACP) are working to protect these 2 at risk populations. Along the 1000 km Tanzania/Zambia highway, gasoline pump attendants offer drivers condoms. Prostitutes at these stops also offer condoms. There are meter long stickers with \"condoms prevent AIDs\" available. The message from the NACP regional office is that those at risk, such as truck drivers, are unlikely to attend rallies, or hear radio message when behind the wheel. Research has shown that men are more receptive to messages given in a work setting. Barmaids at 5 of the most frequented truckstops have been trained as peer health educators. Their job is to sensitize the men to the dangers of AIDs. An operating example is given of the barmaid serving drinks, and when approached, replies with the messages of how protection can be accomplished. One partner only is recommended, and if this is not possible, then one should avoid assuming \"labda huyu hana ukimwi\" (hopefully this one is AIDs free). There is no safe sex. The peer educators are trained in AIDs prevention and communication skills, and are paid a monthly wage. 725,000 condoms and 250,000 pieces of educational literature were distributed by TDAIP at these 5 truckstops in the 1st 6 months of 1990. Several drawbacks to this effort have occurred. It is difficult to sustain the distribution system outside a medical setting, and it is difficult to effectively monitor and support peer educators spread out across the country. One barmaid observed that those seeking condoms were primarily from outside Tanzania: Zambia, Malawi, Zaire, Rwanda, and Burundi, where better information about the danger of AIDs may be available. It is believed that 800,000 Tanzanian men and women are infected with HIV. Many are new faces to whom the 30,000 condoms a week are distributed and she records the truck numbers to see whether awareness is spreading."

This paper describes the sexual behavior of men and women in one such village. The village is located 5 kilometers from a well-known trading town on the main transAfrica highway with an HIV prevalence of 40% in 1991, and is home to an adult population of approximately 250. Many residents make frequent trips to the town by foot or bicycle. Data were obtained over a 6-month period on the daily travel and sexual activities of 26 women and 54 men with focus upon the rate of partner change and the proportion of sexual contacts with people outside of the village. Over 587 person-weeks, the men made 1086 trips, mostly returning home the same day. They reported a total of 1226 sexual contacts, 83% of which occurred in their own village and 11% in a neighboring fishing village. 17% of sexual contacts were with new partners. Although 15 of the women reported being married, 42% of their sex contacts were with casual, paying partners. Of the 11 women who were single, 80-100% of contacts were with paying partners. Most of the women's partners were resident in the village. A high rate of sexual mixing therefore exists in the village, but with little contact with people from outside. Such communities should be targeted in future sexually transmitted disease control programs."

Una estrategia común para disminuir el distrés es que las parejas se adapten a los síntomas del trastorno, lo cual reduce el distrés a corto plazo pero mantiene los síntomas a largo plazo. Se cree que la adaptación está motivada por la reacción conductual de la pareja a las emociones del paciente, pero las emociones de la pareja en este contexto aún no se han analizado. Este estudio piloto examinó cómo la adaptación de la pareja está relacionada con patrones específicos de corregulación emocional entre los pacientes con trastorno por atracón de alimentos y sus parejas, antes y después de una intervención en la pareja por trastorno por atracón de alimentos. Se midió la excitación emocional codificada en la voz durante conversaciones de las parejas (n = 11) acerca del trastorno por atracón de alimentos. Como se anticipó, la reacción emocional de las parejas a la excitación emocional de los pacientes estuvo asociada con una alta adaptación antes del tratamiento. Por lo tanto, las parejas pueden usar la adaptación como estrategia para reducir tanto el distrés de los pacientes como el propio. Después del tratamiento, la excitación de las parejas dejó de estar asociada con la excitación emocional de los pacientes. En cambio, las parejas demostraron una mayor estabilidad emocional con el tiempo, específicamente cuando la adaptación fue baja. Además, los pacientes estuvieron menos excitados emocionalmente después del tratamiento. En consecuencia, el tratamiento pudo haber disminuido la emocionalidad general de los pacientes y modificado la asociación entre la adaptación y la reacción emocional de las parejas. Si se reproduce, esta comprensión del contexto emocional asociada con la adaptación en los trastornos por atracón de alimentos puede fundamentar el tratamiento basado en la pareja abordando precipitantes emocionales específicos de conductas que mantienen los síntomas."

Sexual minority adults (such as gay/lesbian or bisexual) are at greater risk of HBP than heterosexual adults. However, the reasons for this difference have not been studied. Sexual minority stressors are unique stressors specific to sexual minority individuals. Multiple studies have shown that sexual minority stressors, such as internalized homophobia (defined as someone’s internalization of negative societal values towards sexual minority individuals), stigma consciousness (defined as the extent that someone expects to be stereotyped), and experiences of discrimination due to sexual identity, are associated with poor health outcomes. Yet, the relationship between these stressors and HBP has not been studied in this population. In our study, we examined the associations between sexual minority stressors and newly diagnosed HBP among sexual minority adults. Those who reported more internalized homophobia had a higher likelihood of developing HBP within 7 years. There were no significant associations between other sexual minority stressors and HBP. We also found no differences in the associations of sexual minority stressors and HBP by race/ethnicity or sexual identity. Findings highlight the importance of educating healthcare professionals about risk factors for hypertension in sexual minority adults."

The few reports of sexuality in women after spinal cord injury suggests a wide range of adaptability, from 40% to 88% of the subjects achieving satisfactory sexual activity. Some women were able to adapt a positive body image and find new ways of stimulation to orgasm, despite altered body shape, bladder and bowel incontinence, spasticity, and lack of sensation often resulting from spinal injury. The pill, vaginal methods, and IUDs are not recommended, but condoms and possibly Norplant, are appropriate for these women. Menstruation, often ceasing for several months after injury, usually resumes. One study reported lack of menstrual pain, others did not. Many spinal injuries women have achieved 1 or more pregnancies. A few cases have been described of successful pregnancy when the injury occurred during gestation, as has 1 intrauterine death that was successfully delivered by induction. Premature cervical dilatation and labor and small-for-dates infants are more common than usual, but spontaneous abortion are not. Some of the typical problems in pregnancy are urinary tract infections, decubiti, anemia, pedal edema, weight transfer problems, thrombophlebitis, TIA episodes, and nausea. A more serious problem is management of labor, especially if the woman cannot perceive labor pains, or cannot bear down. Frequent check-ups and early hospitalization are recommended. A potentially fatal risk in those injured at T6 or above, is autonomic dysreflexia, stimulated by induction, labor, delivery, or even breast feeding. Autonomic dysreflexia can be treated with epidural anesthesia with lidocaine. Induction is contraindicated. Lactation may cease after 3 months or so because of lack of nipple stimulation."

        "abstract": "This article discusses the spread of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, a region where more than 1/2 of all HIV-infected people live. Of the estimated 8-10 million HIV-infected people worldwide, more than 5 million live in sub-Saharan Africa. Studies indicate that this region holds more than 75% of the world's HIV-infected women and 90% of the world's HIV-infected infants. Moreover, national surveys in sub-Saharan countries show that initial reports claiming that the AIDS pandemic was limited to urban areas were wrong, since rural areas have also suffered greatly from the disease. In developed countries, approximately 50% of HIV-infected people develop AIDS with 10 years. But researchers believe that in Africa the time between exposure to HIV and the manifestation of AIDS, as well as the time between the manifestation of AIDS and death, is shorter than in developed countries. While changes in the behavior among homosexuals and the virtual end of transmission via blood transfusion have led to a decline in rate of new infections in developed countries, Africa and the rest of the developing world continues to see an increase in the rate of infections. In sub-Sahara Africa, heterosexual transmission is the most common means of infection. Mother-to-child infections have also contributed to the spread of the disease. Researchers have also noted significant differences among the clinical illnesses of AIDS patients in Africa and the developed world. And unlike the developed world, Africa has had difficulties with the diagnosis and surveillance of the disease. In the coming years, the effects of AIDS will become even more pronounced in the region, as countries grapple with how to care of AIDS patients and provide for AIDS-related orphans."

        "abstract": "The recreational use of stimulants and injection drugs has contributed significantly to the increase in HIV infections. The effects of various drugs and the changes in behavior associated with the drug abuse are described. While not all drug use constitutes addiction or abuse, it is nevertheless associated with a higher willingness to engage in risky sexual behavior. Treatment for this group is complicated, as the drug use is closely associated with social and sexual behavior. Relapses are common, and patients will need help to cope with both physical and emotional withdrawal."

        "abstract": "Selon des études démographiques à grande échelle menées antérieurement, les hommes homosexuels et bisexuels pourraient courir un risque accru d’afficher des disparités dans leur état de santé. Nous avons voulu déterminer si l’état de santé des Canadiens de sexe masculin et leurs comportements présentant un risque pour la santé varient selon leur orientation sexuelle. À l’aide des données de l’Enquête sur la santé dans les collectivités canadiennes (Cycle 2.1, 2003; n=49 901), nous avons effectué une analyse de régression logistique multivariée pour déterminer les effets indépendants de l’orientation sexuelle sur l’état de santé et sur les comportements qui présentent un risque pour la santé. Dans tous nos modèles multivariés, nous avons calculé les rapports de cotes, les valeurs P, les erreurs-types et les intervalles de confiance (IC) de 95 % par la méthode de rééchantillonnage bootstrap recommandée par Statistique Canada. Comparativement aux hommes hétérosexuels, les hommes homosexuels et bisexuels ne déclaraient pas plus de troubles respiratoires; leurs taux d’obésité et d’IMC en surpoids étaient plus faibles; mais ils déclaraient davantage de troubles de l’humeur et de troubles anxieux, et des antécédents de suicidabilité sur la vie entière. Les hommes homosexuels et bisexuels ne déclaraient pas de taux de tabagisme quotidien ni d’abus d’alcool plus élevés; cependant, les homosexuels faisaient état de diagnostics de MTS presque six fois plus élevés que les hétérosexuels. Cette étude est la plus vaste analyse connue de données représentatives sur les risques pour la santé et les comportements d’hommes de diverses orientations sexuelles. Nos constatations soulèvent des préoccupations importantes quant à l’incidence de l’orientation sexuelle sur la santé mentale et sexuelle. Nous expliquons les contraintes de ce jeu de données, dont celles associées à la mesure de l’orientation sexuelle. Il faudrait pousser la recherche pour comprendre les mécanismes qui influencent la résilience et les disparités sur le plan de la santé que nous avons mises en évidence."

        "abstract": "African-American and Hispanic youth of low income residing in urban settings are at particular risk of contracting and spreading HIV. This paper reports findings from a study evaluating the levels of sexual activity, condom use, and reasons for condom use and non-use among a sample of 1435 minority youth aged 15-24 users of mean age 19.1 in Detroit. Compared against national samples of minority youth, these subjects have similar patterns of sexual behavior, although males and African-American females began their sexual experiences earlier and were less likely to have used condoms or other protection from pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases at first intercourse. 35-48% used a condom at last intercourse in the last year with nonmarital partners that they knew well. Among Hispanic subjects reporting having at least one casual partner in the last year, only 30-33% had ever used a condom with that partner. Further, prevention against both pregnancy and disease were found to be important motivators for using condoms, but many did not use them because they were unavailable or the sexual encounter was unplanned."

        "abstract": "The Chaussez Capote Project interviewed 48 youths in Abidjan and Dabou aged 14-25 years on how to best get individuals in their age group to use condoms. 251 individuals aged 15-25 were also surveyed in Abidjan on the same subject. While more than 80% of this latter group had already discussed AIDS, sexually transmitted disease (STD), and prevention with others, 90% still wanted advice on these themes from medical staff and the media. 40% who had already used condoms did so incorrectly, while approximately 33% had experienced condom breakage during use. Respondents felt that condom promotion should be associated with information on AIDS, STDs, and contraception or information on general health. In response to this feedback, the project commissioned the creation of a promotional music cassette with French and African songs of different musical styles. Lyrics imparted technical information and correct misconceptions related to condom use. Free distribution of the cassette commenced August 1992, and approximately 800 were given to organizations and businesses. The cassette also aired on radio and Ivorian television, but met with only limited success. It is thought that its impact was limited due to the small number of copies duplicated and inefficient distribution. A new version was therefore created with different songs and short messages by popular African singers for local duplication and sale at a subsidized price starting December 1993. As a 2nd intervention, clothing metaphors applied to condoms and condom use were applied to the development of a clothing promotion loincloth designed Spring 1993. The cloth was pretested and revised to ultimately consist of panels depicting 2 young couples, a condom, a panther, and the words Entre nous. The cloth has been ordered for use by the National AIDS Committee, a condom social marketing project, and the French agency for development cooperation."

Survey data were used in the study of factors associated with experiencing first sexual intercourse at younger than age 13. Students younger than 14 years old were excluded from the analysis. 17.8% of White males, 49.2% of Black males, 5.1% of White females, and 11.9% of Black females had had sexual intercourse before age 13. 38% of White males, 12% of Black males, 47% of White females, and 27% of Black females were virgins at the time of the interview. Controlling for race, males were 6.8 times more likely than females to have had first sexual intercourse when younger than 13. Fighting, experimenting with cigarettes and alcohol younger than age 13, and carrying a weapon to school were associated for all race and gender groupings with the early initiation of sexual intercourse. 54.8% of White males, however, compared to 39.3% of Black males brought weapons to school, 51.1% of White males compared to 47.0% of Black males got into a fight at school, 11.6% of White males compared to 5.3% of Black males smoked before age 13, and 39.0% of White males compared to 30.6% of Black males drank alcohol before age 13. Respondents who initiated sexual intercourse before age 13 had greater numbers of partners, but were 50% less likely to use condoms regularly and were two-seven times more likely to have been pregnant or caused a pregnancy. Females who initiated sexual activity early were more likely to have had a sexually transmitted disease. The authors recommend that the ethnic and gender differences observed in this study be considered when designing interventions to postpone sexual activity. Interventions must begin before age 13 and should be both comprehensive and school-based."

        "abstract": "HIV was introduced in India much later than in other parts of the world, but is spreading with unprecedented rapidity and is becoming a public health problem with enormous social and economic implications. HIV in India is spread mainly through heterosexual intercourse, moving from high-risk behavior populations to the general population as indicated by the growing HIV prevalence among voluntary blood donors and women attending antenatal clinics. The main risk behaviors and practices associated with a higher risk of HIV transmission in India include unprotected sexual intercourse, IV drug use, and transfusion of contaminated blood and blood products. Factors affecting the sexual transmission of HIV include the presence of ulcerative STDs, irregular use of condoms, frequency of sexual contact, and age at sexual initiation. Knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about sexual practices, low literacy, and economic conditions also affect high-risk sex behaviors. The authors discuss the historical perspective on HIV/AIDS in India, heterosexual transmission, IV drug use, blood transfusion and blood products, transmission in the healthcare system, perinatal transmission of HIV, homosexuality, and homosexual and bisexual behavior. Though openly tolerated by society, sex between men is common in India. There are few data on HIV prevalence among homosexual men. The risk of HIV transmission among homosexual men could be high because only 0-21% use condoms. Homosexual liaisons are short-lived, especially among bisexuals."

        "abstract": "Tourists traveling internationally lower their inhibitions and take greater risks than they would typically in their home cultures. Loneliness, boredom, and a sense of freedom contribute to this behavioral change. Some tourists travel internationally in search of sexual gratification. This motivation may be actively conscious or subconscious to the traveler. Billed as romantic with great natural beauty, Thailand, the Philippines, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Kenya are popular destinations of tourists seeking sex. The Netherlands and countries in eastern Europe are also popular. With most initial cases of HIV infection in Europe having histories of international travel, mass tourism is a major factor in the international transmission of AIDS. While abroad, tourists have sex with casual partners, sex workers, and/or other tourists. Far from all tourists, however, carry and consistently use condoms with these partners. One study found female and non white travelers to be less likely than Whites and males to carry condoms. The risk of HIV infection increases in circumstances where condoms are not readily available in the host country and/or are of poor quality. Regarding actual condom use, a study found only 34% of sex tourists from Switzerland to consistently use condoms while abroad. 28% of men in an STD clinic in Melbourne, Australia, reported consistent condom use in sexual relations while traveling in Asia; STDs were identified in 73% of men examined. The few studies of tourists suggest that a significant proportion engage in risky behavior while traveling. HIV prevalence is rapidly increasing in countries known as destinations for sex tourism. High infection rates are especially evident among teenage sex workers in Thailand. Simply documenting the prevalence of risky behavior among sex tourists will not suffice. More research is needed on travelers and AIDS with particular attention upon the motivating factors supporting persistent high-risk behavior."

Marked reduction in rates of seroconversion have been recorded among homosexuals in San Francisco and Stockholm, despite high seroprevalence of HIV, due to cohesiveness of the community and intense, direct educational campaigns. Although condoms used with nonoxynol-9 spermicide reduce markedly the likelihood of HIV transmission, heterosexual spread of HIV has not been curtailed. Particularly difficult to reach groups are bisexual men, prostitutes using oral contraceptives, heterosexuals already infected with sexually transmitted diseases, especially chancroid, herpes and syphilis, and young people. In Sweden, needle exchange programs have contained AIDS spread abruptly. Paradoxical effects of fear of AIDS in the drug community have worsened the situation in the U.S. For example, fear that heroin causes AIDS has increased the use of cocaine, with its more demanding addiction, that ultimately spreads HIV more rapidly by sexual routes. Spread of HIV by blood products and to health care workers has become a very rare event recently in the U.S. There is hope that the health message is being articulated more effectively, easing fear and enhancing the response by individuals at risk."

APROFA established a working group to study the knowledge, attitudes, and sexual behavior of students at the National Training Institute, INACAP. 7000 students were sampled in 11 Chilean cities. The study found that 36% of the females, and 77% of males were sexually active before the age of 20. Nearly 1/2 of the women and 1/5 of the men did not know that condoms could protect them against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and pregnancy. APROFA designed a program to increase students knowledge of AIDS, reduce promiscuity and increase knowledge of and use of condoms. In October, 1988 an educational package distributed, consisting of a training manual, slides, educational booklets, a poster, and a video of 3 films. It has proved so successful that APROFA has adapted it for community groups, educational institutions, and its youth program. APROFA/Red Cross nurses and Red Cross volunteers have participated in workshops and training with the package. The Red Cross has organized AIDS-related activities in Chile since 1986, including education campaigns, information for blood donors, and a telephone hotline to provide AIDS counseling. Goals are to target more poor areas and groups outside of society's mainstream in the next year for sex education and information on STDs."

        "abstract": "The importance of birth spacing and the role playedby maternal lactation in achieving proper birth spacing in many traditional cultures in Africa are discussed. The concept of adequate birth intervals, i.e. 2 or more years, has been well accepted in many countries of Africa. Only very intensive, so-called \"natural\" lactation will cause the important reduction in fecundability necessary to achieve this spacing naturally. When the mother has no confidence in her ability to nurse and begins to to supplement the breast-feedings, lactation will become difficult and the contraceptive effect will be reduced. Studies from several cultures are cited as to the effect of natural lactation on the duration of postpartum amenorrhea. African cultures teach the symbiotic relationship between mother and child. This cultural concept has extended the natural contraceptive effect of lactation by prescribing various acceptable periods of abstinence. Rapid change in values in these societies has overthrown certain customs. Less severe practice of postpartum abstinence, use of supplementary bottle feeding, and complete avoidance of lactation in certain areas has undermined the contraceptive effect of lactation. Health education in these areas should stress the beneficial aspects, both to mother and child, of lactation. Supplementary contraception should also be mentioned."

        "abstract": "A Congressional conference on the fiscal year 1992 appropriations bill for the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) was held in October 1991 in Washington, D.C.. Despite what many expected, funding levels were at the center of negotiations for 3 weeks instead of the gag rule which prevented federally funded clinic staff from discussing abortion as an option for clients with an unwanted pregnancy. In fact, the White House was ready to agree to a compromise allowing staff to mention abortion and provide names and addresses of abortion clinics to clients, but White House Chief of Staff Sununu stopped any compromise asserting that antiabortion leaders in the House of Representatives (House) would not agree to a compromise. The President specifically objected to proposed funding levels and would probably have vetoed any bill. So the House omitted 2 abortion related provisions to prevent the President from using the gag rule as an excuse to veto the bill. These provisions included allowing federally funded abortions for poor women who were raped or experienced incest and requiring federally funded facilities to notify parents before a minor could undergo an abortion. The Senate approved a small increase in the Title X family planning program ($144-150 million). Yet the Senate did not allocate money for 2 surveys on human sexual behavior, but instead gave it to the Adolescent Family Life Program. It did appropriate $20 million to the Women's Health Study, however. Maternal and child health block grants received an additional $53 million for a total of $640 million which would go to home visiting and an increase in obstetrician and pediatrician participation in Medicaid. Sexually transmitted disease and HIV prevention programs also received increases."

The first part of the paper describes the official view on prevalence (in 1988 Uganda, with 5455 reported cases, had the third highest prevalence of AIDS in Africa with the disease transmitted largely through heterosexual relations), the official view on the disease origin (the index case of AIDS occurred in 1983 in Kasensero village in the Rakai district), and the official control efforts (acknowledgement and publication of the magnitude of the epidemic and a 5-year prevention and control program with educational, medical, and epidemiological measures). The second part of the paper discusses public perceptions towards AIDS and its victims and highlights beliefs that assign a supernatural etiology to AIDS, social discrimination of AIDS victims, the consequences of the disease on the family and on sexuality and nuptiality. The next section looks at the impact of AIDS on health seeking behavior and the delivery of health care and notes that the private health delivery system has probably contributed to the spread of AIDS because of the use of unsterilized instruments, that unscrupulous practitioners are claiming cures, and that some people avoid health facilities for fear of infection. The fourth topic considered is the risk of HIV transmission because of sexual harassment perpetrated against women. This is followed by an assessment of 1) the affect of AIDS on women's reproductive rights and the controversy about transmission of the virus in breast milk, 2) the situation faced by women in high-risk professions, and 3) the acceptability of the condom. The paper ends by summarizing the policy and research implications revealed by this qualitative study."

A review of the literature on substance use and sexual behavior divided the research into three categories: studies that relate sexual behavior to global measures of drug use; studies that look within groups of gay men at drug use behavior in the sexual context; and studies that look at sexual episodes among individual cases to determine whether the use of specific drugs lead to specific sexual activities. The evidence for a direct association between substance use and increased risk of HIV infection among susceptible gay men is incontrovertible. Simple associational models demonstrate the ways in which the pairing of sex and drug use create a learned association between these activities. The drug-sex relationship may also be mediated by personality characteristics, such as sensation-seeking. Interventions targeting gay men must combine community interventions and individual or small group intervention approaches."

Cet article examine les données scientifiques et les raisons cliniques pour continuer à inclure ces catégories dans la CIM. Un examen des données publiées depuis 1990 a révélé le peu d'intérêt scientifique pour ces catégories. En outre, le Groupe de travail n'a trouvé aucune preuve de leur utilité clinique: elles ne contribuent pas à la fourniture des services de soins ou à la sélection du traitement, et elles ne fournissent aucune information essentielle en matière de surveillance de la santé publique. Par ailleurs, l'utilisation de ces catégories peut créer des dommages inutiles en retardant le diagnostic précis et le traitement. Le Groupe de travail recommande que ces catégories soient entièrement supprimées de la CIM-11. Les problèmes de santé liés à l'orientation sexuelle peuvent être mieux traités en utilisant les autres catégories de la CIM."

Yet some blacks tend to believe that AIDS information is American propaganda to restrain sex. Further others think AIDS is a government conspiracy to distribute condoms to control the number of blacks so there will be fewer blacks when South Africa adopts the 1 man 1 vote position. Moreover some blacks feel that this government or right wing plot serves to undermine the Africa National Congress whose members have been in exile in African countries with high AIDS rates. Besides many black men believe that wearing a condom disgraces them. Even in the event blacks wish to use condoms, condoms are only sold at pharmacies in the townships which are not only open Saturday nights, but, in Soweto, 1 pharmacy serves 3 million people. Nightclubs in townships should also dispense condoms. Still other blacks think that AIDS is confined to whites, homosexuals, and prostitutes. Even though many people are indeed concerned about AIDS, they are not changing behavior to prevent HIV transmission. In addition, blacks tend not seek treatment at the AIDS clinic at Johannesburg Hospital, a former whites only hospital. This reluctance may be due to fear and language problems. The 1st AIDS cases in South Africa were white homosexuals in 1982, but the 1st cases among black heterosexuals did not occur until 1987. These 1st black cases include migrant workers from Malawi and Zaire. As of October 1990, only 500 cases of AIDS have been reported in South Africa, but research show that as many as 63,000 people may be HIV positive. Nevertheless South Africa is the only African country that is equipped with the wealth and skills to deal with the AIDS epidemic."

        "abstract": "As a result of changing expectations of sexuality, women now hope to enjoy sexual relationships well into their later years. 2 clinically important questions for both women and their physicians are: are any changes in sexual behavior to be expected with hormone depletion at the menopause; and what effects do hormone replacement therapies have on sexual response. This chapter reviews the available evidence and discusses the clinical implications. Attention is focused on the following: animal studies (nonprimates, primates, mechanism of action, and methodological considerations); the effects of depletion of ovarian hormones on human sexuality (natural menopause and surgical menopause); the effect of hormone replacement therapies (clinical trial); and clinical implications. Pronounced changes were found in female animals with oophorectomy. Normal sexual behavior could be restored in primates with administration of estradiol and progesterone in doses approximating plasma levels of hormones during the menstrual cycle. In humans bilateral oophorectomy is usually performed in conjuction with hysterectomy, making it difficult to assess the effects of hormone depletion alone. Epidemiological studies suggest a decline in female sexual interest, orgasm, and coital frequency at menopause. There have been a few double blind studies of the effect of hormone replacement therapy on sexuality. A model used extensively in animal research involved investigation of sexual behavior after oophorectomy and subsequent replacement therapy with estrogen and progesterone. The decision was made to utilize this model in order to investigate the effects of these hormones on human females. Women selected for study had undergone a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for benign disorders and were aged less than 65 years. After initial assessment the women were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 medication groups: ethinyl estradiol 50 mcg; levonorgestrel250 mcg; ethinyl estradiol 50 mcg; and levonorgestrel 250 mcg--\"noridol\"; placebo. After the 2nd month there was a significant difference between estrogen containing compounds and the nonestrogen containing compounds for both sexual desire and enjoyment. The difference between norgestrel and the estrogen containing drugs was highly significant for sexual enjoyment. There was also significantly more vaginal lubrication reported after 2 months of ethinyl estradiol therapy than after 2 months of placebo. The highest number of orgasms occurred with ethinyl estradiol."

        "abstract": "Sex workers are learning about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention through peer education. In early 1986, no clinical AIDS case had been diagnosed in Ghana. 1 of 98 prostitutes living near Accra was infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). By the end of 1986, 72 Ghanians were infected with the virus, 63 of them women. This 1st pilot project's strategy was to test the feasibility of an attempt to stop the spread of HIV infection in Accra by increasing spermicide and condom use among sex workers. Discussions were organized with small groups of female prostitutes. An informal communication network already existed among them. Most had heard of AIDS, but did not know how it was transmitted. They thought that they were at risk, but did not know what to do about it. The discussions led to making 6 women leaders or peer educators. After being trained, these peer educators talked with 72 other prostitutes and gave them spermicides and condoms free of charge. In June, 1987, 72 prostitutes took a knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) survey on AIDS/HIV and sex practices. In January, 1988, only 45 of the original 72 completed the follow-up interview. Before the project, 1 in 3 women (among the original 72) understood that they could get the disease from an apparently healthy man; at the end, 9 out of 10 understood this. Reported use of spermicides and/or condoms with customers increased greatly. Only 9 of 72 (13%) reported regular use of spermicides or condoms in the beginning. 6 months later, 89% said they used spermicides and/or condoms regularly. There are some problems with the results. More women wanted to get into the project as word spread about the purpose of the condoms. Another 144 prostitutes were enrolled in a supplementary program. This group bought the condoms at wholesale prices. Peer education has been brought into many HIV intervention programs in Africa, India, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic Republic. 11 female prostitutes were paid to work with 125 of their peers in Cameroon. Peer education has been incorporated into the family planning program of the Mexican Federation of Private Family Planning Associations. This involves 1500 commercial sex workers."

Attention is directed to the following: program policy and planning; major literature reviews on adolescent sexuality; female development and early coitus; the male partner; the competent adolescent contraceptor; and directions for future research (psychological sequelae of early coitus in girls, factors affecting delay of 1st coitus in girls, and the promotion of competent contraceptive behavior). In the less developed countries, efforts to delay 1st birth and increase birth spacing must form part of the overall strategy to upgrade the survival rates and health of infants. Ancillary to such urgent public health policy concerns is the current worldwide spread of the modern feminist social movement, generating pressures to make education and work opportunities available to female adolescents in the 3rd world. Adolescent pregnancy in the developed countries is not a major world health problem; prenatal care and adequate nutrition are feasible for the pregnant teenager. Yet, no cultural supports exist for such mother-infant dyads, and such pregnancies are viewed, particularly by educated women, as reversing a developed nation's social progress. There has been a growing effort in the US to implement contraceptive programs directed at the sexually active female adolescent between menarche and age 18. Issues other than availability of abortion and contraceptive supplies are also operating. Developmental level of the public health service user and specifically psychosexual developmental level, is a factor which must be considered in program policy and planning. Developmentally, the logical course of introduction to sexuality for young females would be solitary masturbation, heterosexual mutual masturbation, and coitus. Cultures at ease with bisexuality would acknowledge homosexual mutual masturbation as part of the development continuum. It is not really known what percent of responsibility for the 1st coital contact belongs to the male adolescent partners versus their female partners. Despite the obvious role of the adolescent male in early coitus, parents, even conscientious ones, rarely lecture their sons about any associated problems except venereal disease. Psychological factors in successful contraception are a major issue with the youngest age group. Locus of control has been identified as a major predictor of contraceptive success by several researchers."

        "abstract": "Findings are presented upon the condom breakage experience of 933 sexually active men aged 17-22 years who had used a condom during the 12 months preceding the study survey. Data are drawn from the 1991 follow-up of the National Survey of Adolescent Males. 23% reported experiencing at least one condom break during the previous 12 months and 2.5% of all condoms used had broken. In multivariate analysis, increased experience with condoms reduced the likelihood of experiencing condom breakage, while recent sex education was associated with an almost 80% decrease in the risk of breakage among young men who used condoms infrequently. Young men who had ever had a sexually transmitted disease (STD) or whose sex partner had had a STD were almost three times as likely as other respondents to have experienced condom breakage. Finally, young men with a household income of less than $60,000 were 2-3 times as likely to have broken a condom as were those with a higher household income."

        "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is more common in people with diabetes compared to the general population. Also, diabetes can increase the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), HIV infection and hepatitis, especially type C between affected couples. The lack of a specific comprehensive health care program for matters related to the sexual health of this group can also lead to the above cases. This study will be done with an action research approach in four phases and several steps. In the first phase [planning], during which the needs and challenges of sexual health of couples with diabetes are explained the suitable and practical solutions and development of sexual health promotion program for diabetic couples. In the next phase, we intend to practically implement and then evaluate the prepared program. Considering that the study of strategic action research is accepted to change attitudes, behavior and performance in the system. It seems that the application of the technical action research method opens the field for the entry of a research team consisting of various relevant experts to implement the plan resulting from It is the participants’ own needs and strategy open. In this study, to obtain data, couples with diabetes, personnel of d clinics related to diabetes, and health system policymakers will be interviewed. Methods such as semi-structured and structured, standardized and researcher-made questionnaires, literature review will be used. After examining the strengths and weaknesses of the implemented program, we will develop a final program to improve the sexual health of couples with diabetes."

Las encuestas recabaron características demográficas, comportamientos de riesgo, e información sobre la red social. Regresión logística (estratificada por género) evaluó la asociación entre el estatuto serológico de VIH y el número de personas de la red social, con funciones diferentes tratadas como relaciones independiente y multiplex (i.e., drogas + sexos). Los que tienen más “relaciones riesgos multiplex” presentan una mayor probabilidad de estar infectados con el VIH, pero sólo entre los que no han participado en el intercambio de sexo (AOR = 3.2). Entre los que han participado en el intercambio de sexo, hombres que recientemente tuvieron relaciones sexuales con hombres presentaron mayor propensidad a estar infectados con el VIH (AOR = 12.6). Estos datos sugieren que las relaciones sexuales y drogas entre personas que usan drogas están interrelacionados. Las intervenciones que se dirigen a relaciones multiplex en vez de relaciones de sólo una función pueden ser más adecuadas para influir cambios de comportamiento."

        "title": "Where are we now in the sexual revolution?",
        "abstract": "Selverstone concludes the there really has been a sexual revolution. An enormous sociocultural change has taken place during the lives of parents of schoolchildren. Parents say they feel that there is an increased openness about sexuality today and greater access to accurate information. They also indicate that they are able to have more open conversations with their children than they were able to have with their parents, and that their children seem to have more opposite sex friendships. However, they also are apprehensive about the acceleration of their children's sexual involvement and observe that the sexual double standard still prevails. Other important changes include the following. 1) There is a continuing acceleration in the number of young people who are beginning to have sexual intercourse. Orr et al reported that in a blue-collar, urban, junior high school in Indianapolis, Indiana, 46% of the 14-year-old girls and 74% of the 14-year-old boys had already had intercourse. In the Kinsey sample, only 28% of 14-year-old boys had intercourse. 2) Discussion of sexually transmitted disease is frank and open. 3) 2/3 of American Catholics use birth control. 4) Between 1970 and 1985, births to unwed mothers increased 50%; today, 1 in 5 births in the US is to an unwed mother. 5) Abortion, a clandestine subject in yesteryear, is now one of the most critical and divisive of political issues. 6) People are waiting longer to get married. Between 1970 and 1984, the median age for marriage rose 2 1/2 years, and since 1956, 3 years. 7) Currently, 72% of all women aged 25-34 work, and both spouses work in 56% of all families. However, economic and job discrimination against women is still the rule rather than the exception. 8) There has been a movement toward a less male-dominated heterosexual approach to religion, also. 9) This is perhaps the 1st generation that has begun to comprehend that perhaps 4-7% of the population will be exclusively or predominantly homosexual. 10) For the 1st time in American history, forced sex in marriage has been recognized as rape; colleges have recently acknowledged that rape may be surpassing theft as the number 1 crime on campus; among adult women, physical abuse by men remains a significant problem; and studies have indicated that 10-25% of all women have been sexually abused or molested as girls. 11) The media graphically display women's naked bodies and sexual organs; books and music often discuss sexual technique and feelings. 12) 85% of the American public favors sex education in the public schools."

        "abstract": "Data from the US National Comorbidity Survey on 5877 respondents 15-54 years of age were used to assess the relationship between retrospectively identified early-onset psychiatric disorders and subsequent adolescent parenthood. Between 21-24% of the sample's male and female age cohorts reported having their first child at ages 15-19 years. The cumulative and conditional probability curves for adolescent parenthood were consistently higher among men and women with prior psychiatric diagnoses of anxiety, affective, addictive, and conduct disorders than among those without psychiatric diagnoses. The diagnosis most predictive of adolescent parenthood was addictive disorders. The population attributable risk proportions of births of first children to teenagers associated with the psychiatric disorders were 11.1% in the teenage female subsample with premarital childbearing, 6.2% in the teenage female subsample with marital childbearing, and 33.7% in the teenage male subsample with premarital parenthood. Physicians and mental health professionals who work with adolescents with psychiatric conditions should be aware of the increased risk of adolescent pregnancy and a mental health component should be added to adolescent pregnancy prevention programs."

        "abstract": "Even though many men complain that condoms reduce their levels of sensation and sexual pleasure during sexual intercourse, latex rubber condoms when used correctly do in most cases block the transmission of sperm and infectious agents between sex partners. Condoms were used as disease prevention devices as early as the 16th century, with animal tissue condoms advertised in Europe by the 18th century for both disease prevention and contraception. Early condoms were tied on with ribbons and reusable. Rubber condoms were developed in 1843. When the use of these latter devices against sexually transmitted disease was first mentioned in the Australian medical press in 1870, however, critics cried that condoms would only encourage immorality. Thinner latex rubber condoms were developed in the 1930s. Condoms and other contraceptives became widely available in Australia by the late 19th century. The author discusses the history of the condom and some other methods of safe sex in sections on the condom, contraceptives, morals, population concerns, restriction of condom availability and promotion, chemical disease preventives, the history of chemical prophylaxis, prophylaxis for soldiers and civilians, the prophylaxis debate, prophylaxis in Australia, and safer sex now."

        "abstract": "Zambia's Integrated Project on Family Planning, Parasite Control, and Nutrition was set up in a government effort to adopt policies and projects to manage population growth. In Zambia, the population is expected to reach 11.5 million people by the year 2000--twice as large as the current population. 2 project areas were chosen to represent both rural and urban settings. Kapata, a typical rural area located on lake Bangweulu in the province of Luapula, was chosen as the 1st project site. The majority of its 15,000 inhabitants are engaged in fishing. In contrast, the Zambia Sugar Company, the 2nd project area is located in Ndola City in urban Kabushi. About 1200 people live within the sugar company compound. In May and July 1985, the integrated project in Zambia conducted a baseline study on these 2 project areas. The average number of members per household in both project areas was more than 5. 74.6% of the women in Kabushi said they were familiar with oral contraceptives (OCs), while only 30% of women in kapata indicated a knowledge of family planning methods. The practice of family planning was very low in both areas. Only 20.9% of the Kabushi respondents said that they practiced family planning (mainly using condoms); 11% of the Kapata respondents indicated the use of a family planning method. In both areas, women of childbearing age indicated that they did not use a contraceptive method cause of the unavailability of contraceptives. Foods rich in protein, carbohydrates, vitamins are minerals are available in the households in both areas. The quantitities and frequencies with which these foods were consumed varied considerablY. The families in Kabushi consumed more protein carbohydrates, and vegetables than the families in Kapata whose diets consisted mainly of cassava and fish. 64% of the mothers in Kabushi breast fed their babies from birth up to 1 year; only 33.3% of the women in Kapata breast fed their babies for the same period. All the families in Kabushi have access to latrines; this is the case for only 39% of the families in Kapata. Parasite infection was 42.9% in Kabushi and 35% in Kapata. The integrated project has been very successful in using parasite control as an entry point for other health interventions. The Zambia study has demonstrated the need for adopting strategies that will suit local conditions. In the case of Kabushi and Kapata, a different entry point was needed. By attending to 3 common health concerns such as eye problems, jigger, and foot infection among children, the project staff made family planning more acceptable to the people in the 2 areas."

Nela, Moniz elabora um discurso de diferenciação sexual ancorado em ampla bibliografia produzida entre fins do século XIX e início do século XX, em um contexto de intensos debates acerca de papéis de gênero. Observa-se que seu autor recorreu a múltiplos dispositivos de significação da sexualidade – como a eugenia e a teoria freudiana – para difundir sua ideia de que “o homem é essencialmente sexual, a mulher é essencialmente mãe”."

        "abstract": "This study sought to uncover gender and social differences in adolescent sexuality and reproduction in Nicaragua through an investigation of age at first coitus and first pregnancy. Data were gathered through a 1993 cross-sectional, community-based survey of a representative sample of 7789 households in the municipality of Leon. Interviews were held with 10,867 women aged 15-49, and more detailed information was elicited from a random subsample of 388 men and 413 women. It was found that median age at first coitus was 17.8 for women and 16.2 for men, with 25% of the population engaging in coitus before age 15. Women delivered their first child at a median age of 19.6 years, whereas men became fathers at 21.2 years. Lack of formal education increased risk of earlier pregnancy for women by 2.5 times, but no increased risk occurred for rural versus urban residence. Earlier pregnancy occurred in women who did not live with their biological fathers during childhood and adolescence (living with a stepfather increased risk of early coitus and delivery even more). Men without a formal education became fathers at an earlier age in both urban and rural areas. The period between first coitus and delivery for women was 21.5 months (20 months for women with primary education or less and 27 months for those who completed ninth-grader or higher). Age groups comparisons (15-20, 21-27, 28-35, and 36-49) showed that the current adolescents were experiencing first coitus and first pregnancy significantly later than the older groups but that the 28-35 age group showed significantly earlier onset of each event. These results point to the need to improve gender equity and women's status and to develop a health care policy that responds to the special needs of adolescents (counseling, access to contraceptives, and availability of safe abortion). Sex education programs must begin at the primary levels in schools because of high drop-out rates."

        "abstract": "A $2 million UNDP project designed to provide assistance to those suffering from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is having problems finding its target population in Uganda. Staff cannot rely on many nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), so money is being directly channeled to villages via local leaders, who weed out the undeserving. Internationally, most funds are directed at prevention, education, and prediction of the social and economic impacts of the epidemic. However, the impact at the national, local, and family levels has gone unaddressed. The approach has been charitable, rather than sustainable. The aims of the project are as follows: 1) establishment of income generation programs for orphans, widows, low income survivors, and communities with large numbers of patients with AIDS; and 2) establishment of skills and resources in local groups to implement and manage the projects. 90 microprojects are currently funded in 20 of 39 Ugandan districts. Funds are channelled through the HIV/AIDS Grassroots Initiative Support Fund. The steering committee includes representatives of the Uganda AIDS Commission and the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development. In an effort to rehabilitate prostitutes in Kampala, $6000 was loaned to 21 women and 15 orphans to buy cooking and sewing equipment. Other income generation programs include carpentry and agricultural projects and piggeries. The project time has been extended by 18 months and funds have increased from $700,000 to $2,000,000."

Mothers were 14-19 years old at delivery. 53.1% were African American and 42.5% were Puerto Rican. All but 2 deliveries were first births. 71.7% lived with their own mothers. 64.6% came from families on welfare. The average number of years of completed schooling was 9.5. At 28-36 months postpartum the average age was 19.7 years, 52.4% lived with their mothers, 52.4% lived off their mother's public assistance, and 17.9% supported themselves. 7.9% were married. Interviews were conducted at 3-4 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and 28-36 months postpartum. 94% had completed interviews by 12 months, and 71% had completed interviews by 28-36 months. 33% of mothers had attended school or graduated through the pregnancy and the last follow-up period. 19% who were not in school at the first birth returned or graduated by 28-36 months postpartum. 12% dropped out before the pregnancy and never returned; 36% dropped out during the pregnancy and never returned. Greater risk of delayed grade placement by 28-36 months was significantly associated with age at delivery and reports of stressful life events 1 year postpartum. Mothers who were more grade-delayed reported more depressive symptoms, more repeat pregnancies, and lower work plans. At 1 year postpartum, school returners reported significantly fewer stresses and more child care support than dropouts. 41% of the mothers had a new mate. 25.7% reported a close relationship with the baby's father. About 80% reported problems with the fathers such as drugs, promiscuity, jail, death, machismo, or physical abuse. Only 39% of attenders had a repeat pregnancy compared to 68% of returners, 93% of dropouts during pregnancy, and 70% of dropouts before pregnancy.

        "abstract": "Adolescence is the period of physical and psychological growth between childhood and adulthood. The author is a practicing obstetrician and gynecologist in New Delhi. Over the course of her medical career, she has identified many myths and misconceptions about adolescents and adolescence. With regard to male adolescents, masturbation-related myths may be the most frequently harbored. Male adolescents have a hormone-driven need to have sexual intercourse, frequently. Masturbation is a healthy, no-cost way to relieve sexual tension. There is neither need to pay a prostitute nor fear of contracting a sexually transmitted disease. A young man can masturbate virtually whenever he wants. Despite the guilt and misinformation implanted by adults that masturbation causes weakness, boys masturbate rather frequently. Also contrary to popular myth, the nocturnal emissions which may result in growing boys as a result of sexual excitement during a dream are completely normal and no reason for concern. Further, boys should not worry about penis size, for, when erect, they all work just fine. People grow at different rates. Menstruation starts when 17% of a woman's body weight is fat. The onset of menstruation may therefore start earlier in well-fed girls compared to in girls who are more lean. The frequency and duration of menses are not constant. Menstrual irregularity therefore does not necessarily mean that a young woman is pregnant or that professional medical treatment is required. Breasts, like penises, serve their intended function irrespective of size. The hymen is a membrane at the opening of the vagina. It may have a hole in the center or the side for the escape of menstrual blood. There are myths that an intact hymen is indicative of virginity, the hymen should be intact until marriage, and the first sexual experience should be painful for a woman. The hymen is elastic and even some prostitutes have been found to have intact hymens. The hymen also may tear due to a fall, cycling, or horse riding. Furthermore, myths exist that kissing can cause pregnancy or AIDS, homosexuality is abnormal and incompatible with heterosexual relationships later in life, and different positions of coitus may adversely affect physical health. Adolescents sorely need sources of sound scientific factual information to dispel their myths."

        "abstract": "Parents, educators, public health officials, health-care providers, religious organizations, and advocacy groups are very concerned about the rise in teenage pregnancy and the increase in sexually transmitted diseases among the young. Some say the increased availability and acceptance of oral contraceptives is directly related to an increase in sexual activity among teens. Less than 50% of women use a contraceptive method at first intercourse. Use is much lower in Hispanic and African-American women than among White women; women with low socioeconomic status, living in one-parent households, or having sex at an early age are the least likely to use a contraceptive method at first intercourse. According to the National Survey of Family Growth, teens engaging in sexual intercourse for the first time, who use a contraceptive method, typically choose the condom. Oral contraceptive use is very low and use at first intercourse has not increased over time. It is only after the establishment of routine sexual intercourse that the pill becomes the preferred method. The use of a condom has more than doubled for the period from 1982 to 1988. Adolescents under age 16 are at greatest risk for unintended pregnancies because this group is the least likely to use any method of contraception. The increase in teen sexual activity over the years does not coincide with an increase in pill use. Education must begin in elementary schools, stressing abstinence, but also include facts about sex, contraception, and disease prevention, because 40% of teens are sexually active by 9th grade. Skills can focus on changing behavior, such as learning to delay intercourse, building self-esteem as well as proper use of contraceptives. Easy, nonthreatening access to medical care can prevent many unintended pregnancies and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases."

A research group from the University of Washington Department of Medicine in Seattle completed a study published in the August 15, 1996 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine. Researchers enrolled 43 men, mostly homosexuals, and three women who had acquired HIV in the previous few months. The study aimed to describe events that led to their infection. Unprotected oral-genital contact was the leading mode of sexual activity in this group. Researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston led another study that found that macaques were easily infected with simian immunodeficiency virus when the virus was placed behind their tongues. Researchers speculate that HIV is carried in seminal fluid and enters the bloodstream through tears or lesions in the mouth. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people use a condom during oral sex and staff of the CDC's AIDS Hotline report that questions about oral sex are prevalent. The exact risk associated with oral sex has been difficult for the CDC to evaluate because oral sex usually occurs in partners who also use other sexual behaviors."

Four cases involved extreme differences of more than 10 days, and these reports also included only one report for the period and were from women aged over 40 years. A comparison of reports of coital activity with those who refused a reinterview showed that women who refused reinterviews reported values at the extremes of the distribution. Either \"last night\" or \"a month ago\" were common responses. There was a significant difference in the number of cases reporting coitus the previous night to the supervisor reinterviewer. Care must be taken in wording sensitive questions having to do with the time of last sexual intercourse. Consideration must be given to the sex and social status of respondent, training of interviewers, and privacy for questionnaire administration. The suggestion is made to limit recall time to within the past week for those with frequent sexual intercourse; for those with low levels of sexual activity, a month might be more suitable. A less well-known supervisor might have affected responses in the reinterviews. In conservative settings in Bangladesh, there may be a need to establish a good rapport. Heaping responses for the reinterview did not fit the expected pattern of quadrupling a week's response. Heaping occurred for numbers ending in \"0\" and \"5.\" The recommendation is made for continued use of the question, because data are reasonably reliable, and this type of information can be useful in estimating monthly coital frequency and fecundability."

        "title": "Epidemiology of HIV infection in women.",
        "abstract": "In sub-Saharan Africa the highest rates of HIV infection are among sexually active young women ( 35 years old). In fact, 15-24 year old women in Africa are more likely to be HIV-infected than 15-24 year old men, indicating that women may have their first intercourse earlier and have older sexual partners than men. HIV risk factors in africa are number of partners, contact with prostitutes, being a prostitute, and a history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The ratio of HIV-infected males is essentially the same as HIV-infected females in Africa. In Thailand and India, prostitutes have some of the highest rates of HIV infection. In the US, the mid-Atlantic, southeastern states and Puerto Rico have the highest rates among parturient women. HIV prevalence is higher among black and Hispanic women than white women and higher among urban women than rural women. 51% of HIV-infected women in the US acquired HIV via IV drug use and 33% via heterosexual intercourse. On the other hand, 55% of HIV-infected women in the UK and in Europe acquired HIV via heterosexual intercourse, while 23% in the UK and few in Europe acquired it via IV drug use. HIV infection among female prostitutes in the US and UK has largely occurred from IV drug use. Transmission of HIV from male to female is more efficient than it is from female to male. Cofactors for heterosexual transmission are vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, presence of AIDS symptomatic disease, STDs (especially genital ulcers),and an uncircumcised penis. Mass education campaigns and counseling have increased people's knowledge about HIV/AIDS in developed and developing countries, but they do not always result in behavioral change. WHO believes that 3 million more women and children will die from AIDS during the 1990s. AIDS mortality will likely affect population growth in Africa and boost adult and infant mortality everywhere."

The sample was composed of 62% females and 38% males, aged 13-18 years. It was found that 29% had engaged in sexual intercourse; among these, 13% were 9th graders and 43% were 11th graders. Increasing age and male gender were significantly correlated with past sexual activity. Older males have more prevalent sexual activity than older females, while younger adolescents showed no gender differences. Male gender was significantly associated with early age of initiation of intercourse. Furthermore, 48% reported using contraception during their last sexual encounter, of which 63% used an effective method (condom, oral contraception, withdrawal) and 37% used a method of low or unknown efficacy. Use of alcohol prior to the last sexual intercourse accounted for 14%. The majority of the participants had discussed or received information on HIV infection at school (92%) or from family (77%). Results showed unmet health needs of the adolescent groups and lower frequency of contraceptive use."

No es claro hasta qué punto aplicaciones GSN tendrían un papel causal directo. Exploramos la relación entre uso de aplicaciones GSN y comportamientos sexuales de riesgo entre HSH y MT en Lima, Perú, analizando datos de una encuesta transversal que evaluó comportamientos sexuales en general y en parejas específicas. Realizamos análisis bivariable para estimar la asociación del uso de aplicaciones GSN con diferentes factores individuales y específicos de la pareja. También aplicamos modelos de regresión multivariables ajustados por edad y educación. Entre 741 participantes totales (698 HSH, 43 MT), 64% conoció al menos a una pareja sexual en los últimos tres meses mediante una aplicación GSN. Los usuarios de aplicaciones GSN fueron significativamente más propensos a reportar comportamientos de riesgo de VIH en general, incluyendo sexo anal receptivo sin condón, y sexo grupal, transaccional y bajo influencia de alcohol o drogas. Tener sexo anal sin condón con una pareja determinada no se asoció con conocer a esa pareja mediante aplicación GSN. Estos hallazgos muestran a usuarios de aplicaciones GSN como una subpoblación particularmente vulnerable entre HSH y MT en Lima. Aplicaciones GSN podrían ser útiles para iniciativas de prevención del VIH en poblaciones prioritarias en Perú."

MéTHODE: Nous avons examiné ces relations à l’aide de l’Enquête sur la santé dans les collectivités canadiennes de 2015–2016. Nous avons utilisé des modèles de régression log-binomiaux pour estimer les associations entre la santé mentale autoévaluée et les emplacements sociaux (l’orientation sexuelle, le genre, la race, l’immigration, l’instruction, le revenu), l’appartenance communautaire et les interactions entre les variables explicatives. RéSULTATS: La mauvaise santé mentale était 1,79 fois (IC de 95% : 1,37–2,33) plus élevée chez les lesbiennes et les hommes gais et 3,3 fois (IC de 95% : 2,89–3,76) plus élevée chez les personnes bisexuelles que chez les personnes hétérosexuelles. Les participantes et les participants LGB de tous les emplacements sociaux ont déclaré une moins bonne santé mentale que les personnes hétérosexuelles, et les personnes bisexuelles ont systématiquement fait état d’une moins bonne santé mentale. Une forte appartenance communautaire modifie cette relation en réduisant les disparités pour toutes les orientations sexuelles et tous les emplacements sociaux. CONCLUSION: Les croisements entre les différents emplacements sociaux et l’appartenance communautaire devraient être pris en compte lorsqu’on aborde les besoins de santé mentale des Canadiennes et des Canadiens LGB."

        "abstract": "This study sought to investigate the patterns of sexual behavior in men and women with genital ulcer disease (GUD) and their relevance to HIV-1 transmission. Participants were 100 Zulu men and 100 Zulu women at the City Health Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinic. King Edward VIII Hospital, in Durban, South Africa; a sexual behavior questionnaire was administered by the same interviewer to all of the above participants who were also included in a study of the microbial etiology of GUD. 36% of the men and 36% of the women continued with sexual intercourse despite GUD. Patients with donovanosis and secondary syphilis were more likely than those with other causes for their GUD to have intercourse despite ulcers. During swab collection, bleeding was observed from ulcers in 59 women and 26 men. Prostitutes were not identified and were rarely named as source contacts. Men had more sexual partner (190) than women (122) during the previous 3 months. Condom use was minimal. Men who migrated between urban and rural areas appeared to have the most sexual partners. Urban women had more partners than women from rural areas. The authors concluded that men and women with GUD are practicing risky sexual behavior and could benefit from behavior modification programs. In this community, men who travel between rural and urban areas and who present late with GUD that bleeds easily are probably the most important high-frequency HIV transmitter core group. A significant potential risk of blood-to-blood contact during sexual intercourse exists in patients with GUD."

Nous avons ensuite appliqué notre modèle pour simuler la propagation internationale potentielle de la mpox dans 42 pays et territoires du continent asiatique, en supposant que le Japon soit à l’origine de la propagation. Nos simulations ont permis d’identifier les pays et territoires présentant un risque élevé d’introduction de la mpox, dont un grand nombre sont des pays et territoires à revenu faible ou intermédiaire des régions du Pacifique occidental et d’Asie du Sud-Est. Nous avons constaté que le risque simulé d’importation s’est progressivement déplacé, au fil du temps, du Pacifique occidental vers la région de l’Asie du Sud-Est, puis vers les régions de la Méditerranée orientale et de l’Europe. Ce modèle simulé correspond généralement aux modèles de propagation de la mpox observés entre 2023 et 2024.

        "abstract": "Two hundred gay and bisexual men of mean age 26.4 years from Juarez, Mexico, were interviewed by the Mexican Federation of PRivate Associations for Community Development (FEMAP) about their AIDS knowledge, sexual behavior, and condom use. 88% were single and never married. 66% self-identified as being gay, 29% as bisexual, and 2% as transvestites; 10% reported having sex for money. 14% had had at least one sexually transmitted disease and 57% were negative about condom use. Having an average 4.46 sex partner/month, most respondents were knowledgeable about HIV transmission routes, AIDS symptoms, and HIV antibody tests. 75% and 77.5%, respectively, reported practicing receptive anal intercourse and insertive anal intercourse. They used condoms an average of 6.47 times in their most recent ten sexual encounters. By profession and social behavior, factory workers and individuals who recruit sex partners from the street reported having more sex partners than service and professional workers and those who meet their partners in bars and discos. Further, the number of sex partners and respondents' age were inversely associated with condom use. These findings clearly highlight the failure of knowledge about HIV to bring about change in sexual behavior among certain subpopulations in the study area. Since homosexuality remains unaccepted in Mexican society, the author suggests targeted peer education and small-group session prevention efforts which do not confront mainstream social structure and values."

        "abstract": "There is a high seroprevalence of HIV among prostitutes in Thailand. In an effort to reduce the incidence of HIV infection, the Ministry of Public Health began a program in 1990 and 1991 to promote the use of condoms during commercial sex. The authors evaluated the effect of that and other programs to prevent HIV infection in Thailand. Five cohorts of 21-year-old men from northern Thailand conscripted into the army by lotteries in 1991, 1993, and 1995 were studied. A total of 4311 men were tested for HIV antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with confirmation by Western blot assay. The 10.4-12.5% prevalence of HIV infection found in the 1991 and 1993 cohorts fell to 6.7% in the 1995 cohort. The seroprevalence was only 0.7% among men who did not have sexual relations with a sex worker before 1992. Over the study period, the proportion of men who reported having sexual relations with a sex worker fell from 81.4% to 63.8%. At the same time, over the period 1991-95, the men's reported use of condoms during the most recent sexual contacts with sex workers increased from 61.0% to 92.5%. In 1995, 15.2% of men had a history of a sexually transmitted disease, compared with 42.2% in 1991. The authors conclude that public health programs in Thailand have led to substantial changes in sex behavior among young men, especially an increased use of condoms."

When sexual partners engage in negotiated safety agreements, they usually do not practice unsafe sex. Successful negotiated safety agreements require reliable information regarding serostatus, as well as open and honest communication relating to the agreement. The advent of new treatments and the emergence of viral load testing potentially increase the complexity of negotiated agreements due to differing interpretations of HIV-seropositive status. Continuing research is needed to investigate what understandings gay men have regarding the new treatments, whether they incorporate these understandings into their agreements, and what happens to their sexual practice in this new context."

In addition to the negative effects of victim-blaming, discrimination, and incarceration which may result from programmatic focus upon the individual, no convincing evidence exists that the health education approach has the desired effect in stemming the transmission of HIV. While apparent success has been met from interventions targeted to select populations, greater individual exposure to education does not necessitate higher degrees of behavioral change. The author notes a critical failure to examine environmental and structural risk factors in the world's most affected societies, and suggests a need to re-evaluate and reorient our approach. HIV transmission in Africa and African cities typically with unbalanced gender mixes, and the fact that women in these settings tend to become infected at younger ages than men are 2 known observations deserving study and action. These phenomena are respectively based i colonial structure dictating large, all-male workforce communities, and a broad lack of educational opportunity for girls and women. Industrial development policies which minimize social disruption and remove men from the center of the workforce, and education policy ensuring greater gender equity in access to schooling should be adopted by national governments and international development donors as measures to directly combat the root of structural risk factors."

Data to test this association are drawn from a prospective study of the behavioral changes made by gay men in San Francisco in response to the AIDS epidemic. Findings culled from data collection during May 1984 and May 1985 are described. The cross-sectional analysis showed that use of particular drugs during sex, the number of drugs used during such activity, and the frequency of combining drugs and sex are all positively associated with high risk sexual activity for AIDS. The retrospective data showed that men who currently abstained from combining drug use and sexual activity were likely to have been at no risk for AIDS over 2 measurement points during the previous year. The men who currently combined drug use with sex were most likely to have a history of high risk sexual activity over the previous year. These findings point to a strong relationship between drug and alcohol use during sex and noncompliance with safe sex techniques to prevent the spread of AIDS. Implications of this relationship for AIDS health education efforts are discussed."

Younger adolescents asked significantly more questions in most categories than older ones. Girls asked significantly more total questions and ones concerning pregnancy, contraception and anatomy than boys. Students attending rural schools asked more questions about venereal disease than those in urban schools, but no other main effects of urban-rural location were found. There were no ethnic differences found. The adolescents' questions ranged from sophisticated to poignantly ignorant, suggesting that the strategy of adapting sex education sessions to fit the concerns of the specific adolescents involved might be valuable.

The project began in fall of 1991 and has expanded to include Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Brazil, Haiti, Jamaica, India, and Thailand; limited assistance is also provided to 7 other African countries, 4 Latin America countries, and 1 in Asia. 4 more countries are in the final stages of negotiations to be included in the project. The USAID mission in the host country and the government must invite AIDSCAP involvement in order for the country to attain priority status. Countries are selected based on the HIV prevalence rate, population size and distribution, level of commitment to HIV prevention/control, capacity to respond to the AIDSCAP plan of action, level of other donor support, the USAID Mission's development priorities, and the Mission's commitment of substantial funds from its own budget. Once involved, AIDSCAP is mandated to implement interventions through in-country agencies."

        "title": "Do African-American men and women differ in their knowledge about AIDS, attitudes about condoms, and sexual behaviors?",
        "abstract": "This study identified a sample of young African-American men and women who were classified as having multiple sex partners or 1 sex partner. Of the 149 men, 71 (53%) had 1 sex partner. Of the 165 women, 29 (19%) were classified as having multiple sex partners and 126 (81%) as having 1 sex partner. Results indicated that the groups did not differ in their knowledge about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, attitudes about condom use differed significantly by gender (p.01) and by multiple sex status (p.001). Angry reactions regarding the negotiation of condom used occurred more with men than with women (p.05). Men and members of the multiple sex partners group tended to engage in more risky sexual behavior. These 2 groups also had a significantly (p.001) higher incidence of gonorrhea. While the multiple sex partners group had significantly more smokers (p.01), drinkers (p.01), and crack users (p.05), men were significantly higher consumers of marijuana (p.001) and alcohol (p.01). Overall, results indicate that African-Americans are knowledgeable about AIDS but there appears to be a gap between knowledge and risky sexual behaviors. Prospective studies are needed to clarify the factors which determine the relationship (or lack of) between these elements. Without such studies, a major part of the foundation necessary for the development of sensitive and effective AIDS prevention programs for this group will be missing."

        "title": "College students' high-risk sexual behavior following alcohol consumption.",
        "abstract": "Several researchers have associated moderate amounts of alcohol ingestion with increased sexual arousal and decreased sexual inhibition. 4000 questionnaires were distributed to undergraduate students at 12 colleges of various sizes and types across the US in a study of whether and how often college students consume alcohol to make it easier for them to have sex with someone. Both public and private educational institutions were represented. Although 2412 questionnaires were returned, 510 students failed to identify their gender. Study findings are therefore based on data from only 1902 students. 59.6% of the sample was male, 89.3% were age 24 years and under, 89.5% single, 97.3% heterosexual, 77.9% White, and 59.6% Catholic or Protestant. 91.3% had three or fewer sex partners in the past year and 58.3% came from families headed by executives. At least once in the past year, 33.2% of men and 17.4% of women drank more alcohol than normal to make it easier for them to have sex with someone else. In those instances, 76.3% of men and 77.1% of women initiated condom use for vaginal intercourse, 67.4% of the men and 76.3% of women used them, and 38.6% of the men and 12.9% of the women had experiences with people that they had just met or who were acquaintances. Multiple regression analysis found no significant difference for condom use during anal intercourse or vaginal intercourse with different types of partners. Other researchers have reported much lower rates of condom use among similar populations, suggesting that the reported condom use rates in this study are probably a high estimate of actual use."

        "abstract": "As part of the preparation for the up-coming International Conference on Population and Development sponsored by the UN, an expert group met in June 1992 in Botswana to consider issues related to population and women. Particular attention was devoted to gender equality, population, and development; reproductive health and the health of families; adolescent fertility, marriage, and reproductive health; family planning (FP) and FP programs; education of girls and women and the relationship of education to fertility, health, and welfare; women's economic activity and its relationship to demographic factors; and the relationship between women, population, and the environment. While both developed and developing countries were considered, the emphasis was on the latter. 32 recommendations for action were addressed primarily to governments and other social institutions and also to funding agencies. The recommendations call for a recognization that health and education are particularly critical for women. They ask for the development of gender-based analysis and assessment of development policies to discover their impact on women. Service delivery to women should be culturally appropriate, and women should be integrated into development initiatives and into management and policy-making levels of social institutions. Responsible parenthood should be promoted as should the assumption of familiar responsibilities by men. Women should have access to safe abortion services. Adolescents should receive the education necessary to protect their reproductive health, and a minimum marriage age should be adopted. FP programs should be appropriate to their clients and should provide safe methods of fertility regulation. Improved and safe contraceptives and pharmaceuticals which will protect against sexually transmitted diseases should be developed, with renewed emphasis placed on new contraceptives for men. Safe sex measures should be promoted. The health of girls and women should receive priority attention, and female genital mutilation should end. Special efforts, both formal and informal, should be made to provide proper education for women. Equal rights in sexual relationships should be promoted. Women should have increased access to productive and renumerative employment free from gender discrimination or discrimination due to familiar responsibilities and safe from exposure to hazardous substances. All remaining barriers to women's rights should be removed. The crucial role women play in protecting the environment should be acknowledged, and women should receive training in sustainable development. Adequate social security and medical care systems should be developed for all women, and women and children should be protected against all forms of violence. Women refugees are in special need of protection and health and FP services. Finally, data collection should give priority to information-deficient topics, research on women's status and demographic processes should occur, and statistical systems should represent the full diversity of women's economic activities and publish indicators on a gender-disaggregated basis."

        "title": "How can we help adolescent girls avoid HIV infection?",
        "abstract": "90% OF Malawi's 9 million inhabitants live in rural areas. Although tradition dictates that young females abstain from engaging in sexual relations until being initiated by a traditional adviser following the initial onset on menses, many preinitiation and premenstrual girls break tradition and say that they receive school fees and gifts in exchange for sex. While these village girls may know that AIDS can kill, most think that they are not at risk. Knowledge, attitude, and behavior were assessed by live-in researchers in a sample of 258 girls aged 10-18 in 2 villages over the period 1991-92. Focus groups were held, in initiations attended and observed, and interviews conducted with girls, mothers, grandmothers, and village leaders. 300 female adolescents were then surveyed in 10 other villages. 70% of the girls had sex before either initiation or menstruation with the average age at first intercourse of 13.6 years. 80% of the girls had heard of AIDS and 14% thought they had a good or moderate chance of contracting it, yet they expressed a far higher perceived risk of contracting other sexually transmitted diseases. These benefits were obtained from radio, church, and word-of-mouth messages that AIDS is transmitted by easy partners, bar girls, and truck drivers, and from someone who looks very ill from AIDS. 55% said they are often forced to have sex; 66% have accepted money or gifts for sex; and 75% would like help in learning how to convince a boy to use a condom. Grandmothers and other elders tell girls about menstruation, hygiene, and illness, while sex education comes largely from peers. Were there widespread motivation to employ condoms, condoms are accessible only in the district hospital which is a 25-mile round trim for many; all surveyed community members favored eventual community-based condom distribution. Study results suggest that disseminating messages through existing communication channels of grandmothers, other elder women, and peers could help correct false perceptions about HIV transmission and personal risk, and condoms need to be more available in villages as well as counseling on their use. It is suggested that a group of interventions could be tested which would build upon the work of the national AIDS program."

        "abstract": "The author rejects the moralistic view of AIDS that distinguishes between natural and unnatural sexual behavior, attributes disease to the consequence of unnatural behavior, and maintains that the only way to deal with AIDS is by adherence to the natural expression of sexuality, namely, life-long heterosexual monogamy. Matthews argues that the purely medical model is the only rational and morally acceptable view of AIDS and that the morally relevant consideration is the obligation to relieve suffering. The triumph of moralism would promote intolerance and social division and the abandonment of compassion and respect for the autonomy of others. The author concludes that the AIDS epidemic, by its sheer horror, offers the chance to adopt more enlightened views which, in turn, are more likely to result in effective measures to control the spread of AIDS."

The college was sampled in 1974, 1979, and 1986. Sexual behavior increased dramatically from 1974 to 1979 and then decreased in 1986 to approximately where it was in 1974. The authors speculate that the spread of herpes contributed to this trend reversal. The 1980s also brought more common knowledge of chlamydia trachomatis, nonspecific urethritis, and AIDS. There is some evidence that the double standard for sexual behavior is not present for the most recent sample, though men are still more apt to desire sex without concern for a strongly bonded relationship. Still, in 1986, they showed some evidence of movement toward having sex within a more committed relationship as compared to men in 1974. It is conjectured that the data reflect an increase in individualism and a weakening of the influence of religion and parental relationship on sexual behavior."

        "abstract": "At least 400,000 Thais are believed to be infected with HIV-1 and the principal route of infection is heterosexual intercourse. Given that the transmission of HIV in Thailand has recently been attributed to contact with infected prostitutes, the authors set out to identify the risk factors for patterns of prostitute visits among northern Thai men. 2417 male conscripts to the Royal Thai Army and Air Force aged 19-23 years who enrolled in 2 military bases in northern Thailand in May and November 1991 were recruited for the study. In interviews, 454 reported never having visited a prostitute, 1385 reported at least 1 episode of sexual activity with a prostitute in the preceding year, and 578 reported having had sex with a prostitute in the past. The multivariate analysis found lower socioeconomic status, early first intercourse, and the use of alcohol, marijuana, smoking, and other drugs to be associated with lifetime and recent sex with prostitutes. Sexual intercourse with female partners, lower price paid at last prostitute visit, and frequency of condom use with prostitutes, however, did not differentiate frequent from infrequent prostitute visitors. With the goal of reducing the degree of HIV transmission among these young men, steps should be made to encourage a reduction in the frequency of sex had with prostitutes, to improve condom use, and to reduce drinking before visiting prostitutes."

A cross-sectional survey conducted in China's Anhui province in 1997 investigated the sexual histories of 1057 men and women 15-49 years of age, 878 (83%) of whom were married. Mean age at both marriage and first intercourse was 22 years for women and 23 years for men. However, mean age at first intercourse is declining over time while marriage age remains stable, providing greater opportunity for premarital sex. 22.8% of sexually active respondents--27.1% of men and 18.9% of women--acknowledged having premarital sex. For 94.9% of respondents, their first sexual partner was their spouse. 2.4% of respondents reported anal intercourse, 4.1% reported oral-genital intercourse, and 2.3% reported both practices. 1.7% of respondents had had a sexually transmitted disease and 7.8% reported more than one lifetime sexual partner. 68% of sexually active respondents reported contraceptive use, primarily condoms (10.4%). Among condom users, 11.9% used them for every sexual act, 30.5% used them only during ovulation, and 57.6% used them occasionally. Logistic regression analysis identified the following factors as significant predictors of high-risk sexual behaviors: younger age at first sexual intercourse, a desire to have multiple partners, more than two coital acts per week, exposure to pornography, higher income, and older age at marriage. These findings can be used in the design of HIV/AIDS prevention programs in rural China. Emphasis should be placed on delayed onset of sexual activity and consistent condom use."

The 2 groups were matched for age and were similar in other respects, excluding the number of sexual partners. Laboratory personnel tested the serum using the ELISA test and confirmed by the H9 exclusionary ELISA and by immunofluorescence using a T cell line infected with HIV. All the women tested seronegative for HIV antibodies. 19% of the prostitutes and 24% of the nonprostitutes had used IV drugs. A substantial number of women from both groups reported using 1 or more other drugs. 37% of the prostitutes and 45% of nonprostitutes claimed to not have used any of the illegal drugs listed in the questionnaire, during the preceding 6 months. 29% of the prostitutes and 33% of the nonprostitutes recorded partners at risk from IV drug use. The number of sexual partners reported by the 2 groups in the month prior to the survey ranged from 1-250 (median 24.5) for prostitutes and 0-4 (median 1.50) for nonprostitutes. For a 1 year period the corresponding figures included 1-3000 (median 175) for prostitutes and 1-13 (median 3.5) for nonprostitutes. More than 1/3 reported having bisexual partners during the previous 5 years. Prostitutes had significantly more episodes of gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, and pelvic inflammatory disease than the nonprostitute group (p.05). 1/2 of the 8 prostitutes who had hepatitis B were IV drug users. 76% of nonprostitute partners and 49% of prostitute partners did not use condoms. Despite the fact that HIV antibodies were not detected in these women, the researchers concluded that HIV could spread rapidly within the prostitution population and back into the wider community through sexual contacts and IV drug use. Current control measures need to be enhanced and the medical community needs to continue to monitor prostitutes' health."

There was a positive relationship between psychosomatic complaints and desire for pregnancy (p less than .05). Frequency of sexual intercourse and contraceptive practice showed a positive association with the number of complaints (p's less than .05 and .01, respectively). Women expecting their 1st child or having previously consulted a physician about sterility increased the number of complaints, while previous abortion decreased them.

Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for the effects of the other variables in the model, confirmed that girls who had been pregnant differed significantly from their sexually active counterparts who did not become pregnant in terms of several recent risk behaviors, age of onset of behavior, and general behavior. Sexually active teens who carried a weapon in the 30 days preceding the survey were 4.06 times (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.75-9.42) more likely to have been pregnant than sexually active teens who had not carried a weapon. The pregnancy risk was 4.88 times greater (95% CI, 1.40-16.95) among sexually active girls who had ever used cocaine compared with never users and the pregnancy risk increased 1.43 times (95% CI, 1.14-1.80) for each additional year of substance abuse. Alcohol use in the past 30 days, on the other hand, was less likely to be associated with pregnancy (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.18-0.76). The pregnancy risk increased 1.75 times (95% CI, 1.26-2.43) for each additional sexual partner during the previous 3 months. For each year following initiation of sexual activity, the risk of pregnancy increased 1.43 (95% CI, 1.14-1.80). Finally, history of a sexually transmitted disease increased the risk by 3.50 times (95% CI, 1.28-9.55). Although the cross-sectional nature of this study precludes assessment of causality and the sample was biased toward in-school youth, the findings suggest a need to address multiple risk factors for adolescent pregnancy."

The final sample consisted of 148 men aged 19-66: 30% had a university degree, 27% were professionals, and 45% were blue collar workers. Only collar workers. Only 7 (5%) were HIV positive. Although 40% had more than 1 partner a month, the rest had either 1 partner or no partners. Receptive hand-anus with receptive anal intercourse was assigned a value of 3; receptive anal intercourse with no receptive hand-anus a value of 2; active oral and/or anilingus a value of 1; having more than 11 partners a month were assigned a value of 4. The scores of 119 respondents (80.5%) ranged from 0 to 3, while 29 men (19.6%) scored 4 to 7. 77% stated that they changed their sexual behavior to mitigate risks; 38% used the condom more frequently; 39% reduced the incidence of receptive anal intercourse; and 48% had fewer partners. 80% were occasionally or often thinking about AIDS; 70% were concerned about getting AIDS; and 36% were preoccupied with this concern. 59% deemed their risk greater than that of heterosexuals, and 87% thought that the combined risk of gays was also greater when compared to heterosexuals. Increased worry was significantly associated with the reduction of risk behavior, but only 1 of the 3 indicators of subjective assessment of risk were statistically significant set against concern about AIDS. Findings indicate that behavior was modified as a consequence of an affective response to the threat of this disease."

International sex workers were identified as women who do not speak English at home and were born outside Australia. Diseases were confirmed clinically, by specimen or culture or by antibody or serological tests. Results apply to 91 local and 123 international prostitutes. 47% of international prostitutes and 34% of local prostitutes were aged 21-25 years. Most international sex workers spoke Thai or a Chinese dialect. 10% of local prostitutes were born in Asia. 90% of international prostitutes were born in Thailand, Malaysia, or China. Local prostitutes were better educated. 7% of the local prostitutes and none of the international sex workers had a history of injectable drug use. Local prostitutes tended to use condoms for birth control, and international prostitutes tended to use oral contraceptives. One international prostitute tested HIV positive. 1 in 7 international prostitutes had gonorrhea and the same proportion had chlamydia. Viral STDs (chronic hepatitis B, HIV infection, and genital warts) were more prevalent, but uncommon among international prostitutes. More international prostitutes had multiple STDs. 79 international sex workers and only 9 local sex workers had an STD. 47% of international sex workers and only 10% of local sex workers had worked overseas as a prostitute in the preceding 12 months. Over half of local sex workers and only 8% of international sex workers consistently used condoms. Failure to use condoms was associated with being an international sex worker. Inconsistent use of condoms among local prostitutes was related to increased age."

        "abstract": "Various studies indicate that men with prostate cancer began sexual activity at a younger age; have a higher sexual, particularly at younger ages; a lower frequency of coitus, particularly at older ages; or a higher frequency until around 50 years old, at which time it falls. These findings add weight to the hypothesis that prostate cancer is linked to high testosterone levels. Aggression, criminal violence, impatience and irritability, hostility, reduced tactile sensitivity, and sensation seeking are all associated with high testosterone levels. Variety of sexual experiences is a sensation-seeking behavior. In fact, amount of heterosexual experience, number of heterosexual partners, and interest in erotica are significantly associated with high testosterone levels. Coital frequency of men with high testosterone levels are high early in marriage while low later in marriage, indicating a high degree of variance. Prostate cancer is also associated with divorce, sexually transmitted diseases, and patronage of prostitutes, which factors are secondary to a causal association with high testosterone levels. Some research suggests a link between prostate cancer and vasectomy. If indeed this is true, this association may be secondary to the link of both prostate cancer and vasectomy to high testosterone levels. Men choose to undergo vasectomy, and sensation seekers generally volunteer for unusual experiments. This gives more credence to the hypothesis that the association between prostate cancer and vasectomy is secondary to high testosterone levels. Some reproductive specialists suggest that the ductus deferens transports high levels of androgens from the prostate. Thus, if followed to its logical conclusion, vasectomy should protect against prostate cancer. So the argument that both vasectomy and prostate cancer are associated with high testosterone levels may account for the link between vasectomy and prostate cancer."

Comparamos el estado de infección de VIH, y los comportamientos del riesgo de inyección y sexual asociado con el uso de poli-drogas entre las personas que inyectan drogas (PID) en 2012–2013 en Kohtla-Järve (Estonia, n = 591) y San Petersburgo (Rusia, n = 811). Utilizando el análisis de la clase latente, identificamos cinco clases de uso de (poli)drogas, el más grande constituido por inyectores de una solo droga, inyectando un único opioide (56%). Las cuatro clases restantes incluyeron inyectores de <i>poli</i>-<i>drogas/poli</i>-<i>rutas</i> que inyectaron y usaron opiáceos y estimulantes (9%), <i>poli</i>-<i>inyectores de opiáceo</i>-<i>estimulante</i> que inyectaron estimulantes de tipo anfetamina con un opiáceo primario (7%) y <i>poli</i>-<i>inyectores de opiáceo</i>-<i>opioides</i> que inyectaron opiáceos y opioides (16%). Los <i>co</i>-<i>usuarios de estimulantes no inyectables</i> eran inyectores que también usaban estimulantes no inyectables (12%). En las regresiones multinomiales multivariables, las cuatro clases de uso de poli-droga se asociaron con mayores riesgos de inyección que la inyección de un solo fármaco, mientras que la <i>poli</i>-<i>inyección de opiáceo</i>-<i>estimulante</i> y la <i>poli</i>-<i>inyección de opiáceos</i>-<i>opioides</i> también se asociaron con tener múltiples parejas sexuales. Comportamientos más riesgosos entre los inyectores de poli-drogas sugieren un mayor potencial para la transmisión de infecciones transmitidas sexual y por la sangre. Además de la provisión de agujas y jeringas, los servicios adaptados a los perfiles de riesgo en las PID podrían considerar incluir estrategias de tratamiento y de reducción de riesgo de transmisión sexual adecuadas para los usadores de diferentes drogas, para reducir la transmisión del VIH."

        "abstract": "Minorías sexuales mayores (p.ej., gay, bisexual) que viven con VIH están en riesgo de resultados negativos de VIH debido a sus experiencias con desafíos psicosociales y barreras estructurales. Este estudio uso selección de variables de búsqueda estocástica (SVSS) para explorar factores psicosociales y estructurales asociadas con resultados de salud relacionado a VIH entre una muestra comunitaria de minorías sexuales mayores (N = 150) el la Sur de la Florida, un epicentro de la epidemia de VIH en EE. UU. Después de SVSS, una regresión de entrada directa sugirió que vivienda inestable, uso de sustancias ilícitas, consumo actual de nicotina, y depresión eran asociados con menos adherencia de terapias antirretroviral entre adultos mayores de minorías sexuales que viven con el VIH. No se encontraron asociaciones entre correlatos potenciales y medidas biológicas de VIH. Recomendaciones destacan una necesidad de concentrarse en múltiples niveles de intervención que apuntan una combinación de factores psicosociales y estructurales para mejorar resultados de VIH entre las minorías sexuales mayores y lograr las metas de Finalizando la Epidemia del VIH."

        "title": "Partner number and use of COVID-19 risk reduction strategies during initial phases of the pandemic in British Columbia, Canada: a survey of sexual health service clients.",
        "abstract": "RéSUMé: OBJECTIFS: Les premières directives de santé publique sur les rapports sexuels et l’infection par la COVID-19 portaient sur la réduction du nombre de partenaires. Nous avons caractérisé les personnes ayant eu de nombreux partenaires au cours des phases initiales de la pandémie. MéTHODE: En Colombie-Britannique, la première vague de cas de COVID-19 a déferlé du 14 mars au 19 mai 2020, puis a été suivie d’une levée progressive des restrictions sanitaires. Nous avons administré un sondage par courriel auprès d’usagers existants des services de santé sexuelle entre le 23 juillet et le 4 août 2020. Nous avons procédé par régression logistique bivariée pour examiner l’association entre le nombre déclaré de partenaires sexuels depuis le début de la pandémie et certaines variables clés (seuil de signification p < 0,01). RéSULTATS: Sur les 1196 usagers de notre échantillon final, 42 % ont dit avoir eu 2 partenaires ou plus depuis le début de la pandémie, avec une probabilité plus élevée chez les participants qui étaient des hommes ayant des relations sexuelles avec des hommes et ceux qui étaient célibataires ou dans une relation ouverte avant la pandémie. Ce groupe était plus susceptible de percevoir une stigmatisation des relations sexuelles durant la pandémie, et il a présenté l’utilisation la plus élevée de stratégies pour réduire le risque de contracter la COVID-19 lors de rapports sexuels (principalement en réduisant partiellement ou à zéro le nombre de partenaires, p. ex. en se masturbant, en limitant ses partenaires aux membres de sa « bulle» ou en s’abstenant de tout rapport sexuel). CONCLUSION: Les usagers des services de santé sexuelle de la Colombie-Britannique ayant eu 2 partenaires ou plus durant les premières phases de la pandémie dans la province ont employé des stratégies pour réduire leur risque de contracter la COVID-19 durant les rapports sexuels. Notre étude confirme la validité d’une approche de réduction des méfaits dans les directives sur le risque de contracter la COVID-19 durant les rapports sexuels et souligne le besoin de pousser la recherche sur la stigmatisation des rapports sexuels durant la pandémie de COVID-19."

        "title": "The sexually active teenager.",
        "abstract": "This discussion of the sexually active teenager provides a statistical analysis of sexual behaviors and reviews developmental issues, contraceptive usage, adolescent pregnancy and its associated problems, and sex education. Major changes have occurred over the past 2 decades in sexual mores, contraceptive technology, the acceptance of single parent families, and the availability of induced abortion. In the US adolescent pregnancy and epidemic venereal disease have become major child health problems. It is important that the pediatrician, family practitioner, nurse practitioner, and mental health professional are aware of the magnitude of these problems and their potential areas for intervention. Various epidemiological studies of sexual behavior have documented an increase in the number of sexually active adolescents over the last decade. In a survey of metropolitan adolescents, Zelnik and Kantner found that the reported sexual activity among 15-19 years old adolescent girls increased from 30% in 1971 to 50% in 1979. Among never married white teenagers in this age group, statistics from 1971 indicated that 23% were sexually experienced, and this incidence increased to 42% in 1979. Much less is known about the sexual behavior of younger adolesents in the 11-14 year old range. The increased number of adolescents involved in premarital intercourse, coupled with the earlier age of menarche and delayed marriage, has increased the risk of premarital pregnancies. The number of adolescents between ages 15-19 experiencing a premarital pregnancy has increased significantly from 8.5% in 1971 to 16.2% in 1979, the most notable increase occurring among white teenagers. Among sexually experienced 15-19 years olds, 32.5% have experienced a premarital pregnancy. Sexual behavior among young adolescents is influenced by several variables, including maturation, personal values about premarital sex, inclination, and opportunity. There is an increasing tendency for adolescents to view sexual behavior as a matter of personal choice rather than a morality issue. Adolescents in all stages of development may delay obtaining adequate contraception. Denial of fertility is a common theme in early as well as late adolescence. The consistency and responsibility required for effective contraceptive use is not always compatible with the stage of adolescent development in which they have chosen to become sexually active. Use of effective contraception is often related to increasing sexual activity, increasing closeness of a relationship, a pregnancy scare because of a late or missing period, the positive influence of friends and family members or physicians, and/or the actual discovery of a contraceptive program. For adolescents access to contraceptives has been problematic and prescription contraception is frequently discontinued with continued sexual activity. Feelings of despair, worthlessness, and chronic school failure appear to be common factors among adolescents who choose to carry a pregnancy to term. Sex education courses should facilitate decision making about responsible sexual behavior."

        "title": "A bright future for IUDS: new technology and research trigger expanded interest.",
        "abstract": "Refuting research findings on IUDs from the early 1980s, and controversy over the safety of the Dalkon Shield, research published over the past 10 years indicates that modern IUDs are safe and effective for most women. Better understanding of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) reveals PID to present no more frequently among IUD user selection, insertion, and monitoring techniques are followed. Following such guidelines, and avoiding use in women at high risk for infection from sexually transmitted diseases (STD) will generally provide effective, acceptable, and inexpensive protection against pregnancy. The TCu 380 A IUD has in fact proved to be as effective as injectables or newly- developed hormonal implants. Accordingly, expanded use around the world is encouraged. The IUD has already become the most widely used from of reversible contraceptive with 85 million users in China, developed nations, Indonesia, Mexico, Egypt, and India. China claims 60/85 million users. Family Health International clinical trials involving 10,000 women in 23 developing countries during the period 1985-89, found declining removals due to complications, with increasing rates of method continuation. Women having a baby are ideal candidates for IUD acceptance and insertion. Such women may receive IUD insertion 10 minutes following expulsion of the placenta, while not posing risks to safe breastfeeding. Method drawbacks include the need for trained health professionals in insertion, removal, and follow-up exams over the 1st 3 months following insertion. IUDs also do not protect against STDs."

        "title": "Partner condom use among adolescent girls with sexually transmitted diseases.",
        "abstract": "This research explored the associations of self-reported condom use with sexual knowledge and behaviors, perceptions of peer condom use, and communication with sexual partners about condom use among adolescent girls with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). A total of 24 adolescent girls, 13 with cervicitis and 11 with pelvic inflammatory disease, were given a 62-item self-administered questionnaire. A total of 22 respondents had complete data for analysis. Compared with girls who reported low frequency of condom use, girls who reported condom use all or most of the time were younger, were less likely to have a prior history of STDs and were more likely to think that all or most of their friends use condoms. Compared with girls who had not used a condom with last sexual intercourse, girls who had used a condom were younger, had fewer lifetime partners and had higher mean scores in condom use negotiation, and were more likely to think that all or most of their friends used condoms. Knowledge about condoms and STD prevention was high but was not associated with condom use. This study concludes that STD interventions for partner condom use among high-risk adolescent girls must recognize the decrease in condom use with increasing age and focus on maintaining safer sex behaviors, building condom use negotiation skills, and promoting the perception of condom use by friends."

        "title": "Sexual relationships, risk behaviour, and condom use in the spread of sexually transmitted infections to heterosexual men.",
        "abstract": "To investigate the factors associated with sexually transmitted disease transmission, 957 consecutive heterosexual men attending a genitourinary clinic in London, England, in 1993-94 for the first time were enrolled in a prospective cross-sectional study of sexual behavior. 623 men (65%) reported sexual contact with nonregular partners. The respondents who reported nonregular sexual partners were significantly more likely than those who had sex only with regular partners to be white-collar professionals, to have had intercourse with women born outside the UK, to have had first intercourse before the age of 16 years, and to have had more sexual partners in the preceding year and over their lifetime. They were also significantly more likely to smoke, drink, practice anal intercourse, and to be infected with chlamydia. However, 86% of these men reported condom use with nonregular partners. Despite these differences in sexual behavior, men with nonregular sexual partners were at significantly increased risk only for chlamydial infection. Increasing condom use with regular partners was associated with a decreasing incidence of urethral infection and candidal balanitis. There was evidence of oral transmission of urethral gonorrhea and chlamydial infection among men who reported consistent condom use. HIV infection was found in only 2 men (0.2%), both of whom reported sex with women born outside the UK. Overall, these findings indicate that many men who practice high-risk sexual behaviors (multiple partners) take steps to compensate for this risk through condom use."

        "abstract": "Persons treated at sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics have been shown to be at increased risk for infection with HIV. On the basis of a cross-sectional survey, levels of condom use among 2257 patients treated at six STD clinics in Switzerland between July 1990 and December 1992 are presented, and sociodemographic and behavioral factors associated with self-reported never use of condoms analyzed. The patients were treated at the five university polyclinics of dermatology of Basel, Bern, Lausanne, Geneva, and Zurich, and the city polyclinic of dermatology of Zurich. All were attending the clinic with a new episode of at least one selected STD and had not been seen for any STD within the previous 90 days. There were 1751 self-reported heterosexual men, 268 homosexual or bisexual men, and 238 heterosexual women. 46.3% of the patients reported that they had never used condoms. Among heterosexual men, that level was 48.3%, among homosexual and bisexual men it was 21.6%,, and among heterosexual women it was 60.1%. Factors significantly associated with never use of condoms among heterosexual men included age over 29 years, not of Swiss origin, low level of education, few partners in the preceding six months, contraction of the sexually transmitted disease from a stable partner, and not being an injecting drug user. These findings highlight the importance of condom promotion activities provided by STD clinics."
